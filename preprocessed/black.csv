"""Let's get the black folks and the white folks at each others' throats"""
"(from the internets)

White People: ""Black people should protest peacefully!""

***Black person sits during national anthem***

White People: ""No, not like that."""
Another rabidly racist post from an angry black male with a victim mentality looking for reparations.
"Trump also says:

""It's freezing and snowing in New York - we need global warming!""

""You know, it really doesn't matter what the media write as long as you've got a young, and beautiful piece of ass.""

""... if I were starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black.""

""My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my body.""

""I think the only difference between me and other candidates is that I'm more honest and my women are more beautiful.""

""Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are little short guys that wear yarmulkes every day."""
Do white people march in the streets when violent white offenders are killed by the police?  Calling for the death of police officers because violent black offenders resist arrest violently and are shot because of it?  Disgusting.
"Yeah, the motive is to insult the blacks and make them look as if they are the real culprits of SA while the real culprits are paying these whites to talk shit"
Very few black women are impregnated by whites and very few homicides in Chicago are by whites.
And black bigotry emerges again.
Black idiot or white idiot. What is the difference?
"No, it was not built on the premises of white supremacy and eternal slavery for blacks."
Criticize a black man and the left calls you a racist.  Criticize a woman and you are a sexist. Now I will critcize you as a fool and you can call me intolerant.
This also sounds like any number of blacks.   Are you one of them?  Are you a member of the Black Riders?
"Bunch of kneeling illiterates squatting on a lie, while black on black killings continue at record levels in cities"
"Option 5: just drop the useless thing. Everyone knows who kills indigenous women but this is not what the indigenous leader wants to talk about, they want to talk about the police and ""systemic racicism"". This reminds me of Black Lives Matters who attacks the police for killing black men but won't talk about black on black crimes that kills way more black men then the police."
"If a white entertainer wrapped a noose around, and hung a little black kid in a video you and your ""ilk"" would be singing a different tune.

LMAO"
ITS A RACE BATING GAME TO AVOID THE TRUTH AND FACTS.WE ALL KNOW; ISLAM ENCOURAGES THE RAPE AND BEATING OF WOMEN ESPECIALLY NON MUSLIMS.. ITS A RIGHT THEY FEEL THEY HAVE. TORONTO.  SERIAL RAPIST WAS MUSLIM 1000 WOMEN HE RAPED. THIS ARTICLE IS SMOKE AND MIRRORS. WE ARE NOT STUPID. #BlackLivesMatter dont let them pander to you! this is not a color thing this is a religious culture issue that the left is using you to hide. wake up Black Men. Don't take the bait.
"I tried to replace ""white"" with Native, Black and Muslim......and guess what?   It didn't meet civility standards.....lol.....it is all such a pathetic joke anymore."
"Oh please.  How silly.  Where is the leadership in the Black communities.  Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton?  No they just keep telling their base how downtrodden they are in order to justify there personal existence, and keep the money flowing into their racist organizations.
These players are just whinners, who know nothing and propose NO solutions, as they drive away from the stadium each Sunday in their $200,000 dollar Lamborghinis."
"Get behind Transgender, homosexuals, blacks, native indians, hispanics, Muslims,
Jews and defeat Trump"
more whites are killed by cops actually. it's just that relative to population % blacks are killed at a higher rate. maybe it's because blacks commit way more crime than whites per capita.
Boo hoo hoo McCoy.  Don't even try to pull that old race card in Hawaii.  Black lives do not matter here where the majority of folks are not white.  Folks like you are the reason blacks are so despised.  You can't earn respect by whining. Go back to your kind.
"Asian countries for Asians.

Black countries for Blacks.

but White countries for Everybody?

That's GENOCIDE!

"This is the worst coverage of this situation ever.  You suck Tom Rogan because we all know that police profile...Stanford researchers have found that police in that state are more likely to search black and Hispanic motorists, using a lower threshold of suspicion, than when they stop white or Asian drivers.  Lets just accept this as fact and realize that she was racially profiled and these two punk ass RACIST cops need to become metermaids."
"In 1976 Parklands and Century City didn't exist. What's your point apart from being prejudiced? Population growth and migration are facts of of human development since the dawn of time but it appears bigots, who're always noting Eastern Cape 'refugees' and the expansion of black suburbs, don't understand or won't accept this fact. 
For those who don't go there, areas like Table View, Parklands, Century City, Somerset West, etc are like another city, so has it expanded within the last 15 years, never mind 30, much of it new. Are you saying residents of CT's old suburbs - before these new white (and black) ones - should resent ALL relative newcomers. (Where do YOU live btw?) Get over it!
In 2006 a city water engineer told me new developments were straining the city's water and sanitation capacity. I'm tired of ignorant comments blaming the DA's incompetence on others. I value freedom of speech but sometimes it's a pain having to hear/read the rubbish, on all sides."
"""Black males are disproportionately shot by police."" Go on... what else is disproportionate about black male behavior? You're so close but just won't put your finger on it, will you Washington Post? Honestly, committing 50% of violent crime and only being 25% of those shot by police sounds like it would be evidence of police bias in their favor..."
"I'm soooooo tired of this dumbass DemoKKKrat.  This Dizzy Twit and the rest of the Congressional Black Caucus is *worthless*...

Despite being in Congress for 20 years - This race-baiting POS has sponsored exactly THREE (3) pieces of legislation. No...I'm not kidding.  As a Black Conservative - I DESPISE this obnoxious, race-baiting, utterly dishonest piece of sh*t."
Frazier would been branded an uncle Tom if he stayed. Blacks don't respect the KKK.
Ussien Bolt showed more respect to our anthem than Gabby! She's an idiot who got sucked into the political show but her background as a gymnast doesn't jive with 98% of all other athletes and people in the world of real and respect. The only place the skill she learned is going to be useful is at the Olympics no where else because she refused to incorporate discipline and respect into her actions. Stop kissing blacks asses.
I am sick of racist blacks. Boycott pro sports!!
"Many times, Trump asked Black Americans if they were any better off after 8 years of Obama . It was obvious that many agreed with Trump they are not. The American shame was the wanton violence black voters had to face from Democrats if they come out publicly and said so.  They dares not post a Trump sign on their property lest their cars and homes be damaged. by people against Trump.   Black people voted for Trump. but all of them are written off as  imbecilic  white trash."
probably because one party controls the Congress and White House.  But what nightmare are you talking about - someone governing while black?
"Your statement is so rife with ignorant that you think ""unarmed"" means not a threat. What demographic commits the highest per capita rate of crime and what does that mean regarding per capita rates of contacts with police? Can you put that together?

What you're saying here is that the ""racist"" courts protect black communities better by putting black criminals in jail longer and letting out white predators earlier so they can go back to predatorializing on white communities.

Do you even THINK through what you're saying here?!"
"Nope he's African American. Must be nice living in your bubble of lies and denial! And I don't think color of there skin has anything to do with it. These kids just found someone to buy them alcohol and got drunk drove and someone died. It's happened before and it'll happen again.  Black, white, Latino or whatever nobody's immune to stupidity or the affects of alcohol behind the wheel."
"oh really olrun? you are the ignorant one. ask the native peoples that practice it! animal sacrifice, killing albinos, etc. etc. the black arts are alive and well."
"If she is a nigger, she isn't worth a flying fuck to Africa!"
"Equally repugnant to white Supremacists, Nazis, etc. are BLM and antifa commies. This violent confrontation was a false flag op set up by leftist factions in VA. I am white, and I don't like people going around calling for my extermination any more than Blacks like it. The counter protesters are every every bit as evil as the protesters on the other side. It's the same paid rioters (leftists) that have been around for a long time now. These are not protesters with a beef. These are paid anarchists financed generally by George Soros & associates to disrupt society. Soros is a monster and why he is not removed from the stage, I cannot fathom. Emily Jashinsky, the writer of this article sounds like a useful idiot, a self hating white woman who's been poisoned by PC. There is no balance to the content at all. The writer loses credibility when the bias is obvious."
"MOAR SCARY BLACK PEOPLE NEWS, ADN!

"Putting a black in charge to fix the corruption of whites, this is lame seriously."
"Conservative angst over dead black babies is the most laughable concern trolling.

Talk to me when the conservative movement gives the first damn about live black babies."
"You're evidently against the man because he's black. Thus, ""I deem you racist!"""
I'm white and was mugged at knife point by two black men at Shea Stadium. Spare me your bleeding heart BS about racism.
We already know that you're a racist who doesn't think black lives matter.
Blacks are intellectual inferiors even to Mexicans!
"This is what they chant when protesting, how do you read this.
Black Lives Matter Protesters Chant 'Pigs In A Blanket, Fry 'Em Like Bacon!' KILL THE COPS!

Are you calling ""cops"" fascist thugs?"
We already know that you're a racist who doesn't think black lives matter.
"This is the best move to make on Putin and his unscrupulous hacker cohorts. Even then, some GOP lawmakers from the deep south are on the warpath and its only because they're cowardly bigots from the get-go. Obama is Black. They're white folks and how dare a black man get in front of them. Cowards. Racists."
"Point us to where and when Republicans had the black family all squared away, ignorant racist."
Racism in white people is considered   vile. . For  Black people it is a path to success.
"Alaska Republicans, stay outta this. Ya'll don't want us brown and black folks, we'll be here forever. Can't stop us from propagating..LOL."
Really? Blacks asking for fair treatment is hating cops?
"What a racist administration!  So hispanics, philippinos, blacks, indians,and poor old whitey will not get the jobs on federal land, but they will get to pay for the natives hired by the feds to do the so called ""work"".  Racial discrimination pure and simple fostered by the Obama administration.  This is proof enough we can not allow Clinton to take the presidency. She will be Obama on steroids."
Bunch of racists!  I suppose all BLACK bears look alike huh?
"You people are worrying about the wrong thing. First of all I am a black man. I am not an uncle Tom or a coon. You actually might say I am ultra militant. But for you to raise this hot button issue in polarizing times like this only serves to drive a wedge between those who might be like minded and supportive of your core causes. Who gives a shit about the anthem? They can have it, after all we have ours. This old woman should not have any say in running the organization if that is what her leadership is about. Don't stand for it it if that is your preference. But don't take it away from those who want to. And there are many blacks that want to. Danny Davis is a fool to bring this nonsense to capitol hill. He is like Al Green of Texas and is a nobody in the congress. All he is doing is attempting to raise his profile. And this old woman who is president is trying to make herself relevant. Do this sit down and STFU and try to help us reclaim the Congress. This only hurts."
"black folk must fix black folk_ I am black and hatred exists even within the family._since you are a member of the ANC, ask your bosses where are the schools?all the good schools, hospitals and townships were built by the <RACIST WHITES>_ the real problem is the absence of good schools in black areas.  the ANC IS THE DEVIL"
Black power?????  What a joke.
I agree. African Americans should deprive the white Southerners the right to vote. The Vietnamese should be allowed to bomb the country that bombed them. Golden Rule and all
"You just can't stand that a women and black man had power. Trump lies, Trumps people lie, trump has illegal ties with Russia. Trumps moral actions are disgusting. You are a traitor to this wonderful country."
"I didn't hear Trump say ""black sobs"" or ""African American sobs"" I just heard him say sobs. Last I looked white players were kneeling as well. 

Trump is a goof for wading into this debate but he hasn't said anything that is racist."
"Hey Mateo, ever been to Texas? It's the second most diverse state. Lots of black and Hispanic police officers. What a stupid press release."
"Justin represents all the people Gays, transgenders, blacks, brown, chinese, Jews, Muslims, Native Indians, not like Trump who just represents white people and christians. Thats the inner beauty of Justin and the outer ugliness of Trump."
And the vast majority of murders in the US are family on family.  Your point is what?  I can continue to enjoy unfettered white privilege because blacks kill blacks in their own neighborhoods and whites kill whites during white supremacy demonstrations?
"""Black men are primarily responsible for that."" This part of your statement is true. This country would not exist were it not for millions of black slaves. The colonies from Maryland south would never have joined the ""Revolution"" without protections for race based slavery. We would be more like Canada without race based slavery.  In 1860, 80% of the wealth of the nation was from slaves, slave labor, and the products that labor produced. The violence today is a product of our history. The rest of your statement is just fake news."
"The guy who confessed in St.Louis was African -American. I guess we can expect outrage against all
Blacks in the U.S."
"dude, racism isn't a bipolar criteria. I know some racist old rich men who dates attractive women of color particularly Asians yet yaps all over how other non-white races are inferior and a lot of disgusting ugly words about them. How is this possible? Racism is fueled by favoritism, need to win and beat other races sometimes by unfair and Machiavellian ways, need for fragile external ego. Dating an attractive non-white woman wouldn't surprise me of trump. Also being nice to black people in front of their faces and not behind closed doors is a hallmark of two-faced snarky individuals. There are racists that are less smart and others who know when being racist publicly would have costs. Imagine you were a racist white guy who walked up to a group of muscular black youth and told them they were n*ggers. Doesn't necessarily prove he's clearly a racist via proof but Trump doesn't speak against racism and reeks of hubris."
"""Youre ignorant. If e wins (he wont of course), then no one is safe. Blacks, Jews, gas, women-al will be refused for religious nonsense reasoning. We will NEVER allow that""

Are you threatening violence against the United States....are you threatening civil war against the Unites States.....should ""your side"" lose?
-
If so, you are more of a threat to this nation than a baker who declined to decorate a cake will ever be."
"LOL! Yes, she lost because she's a woman just like Obama lost because he's black. Oh, wait... Hillary had nothing to offer, had no message, basically carried an empty bucket... gilded, but empty."
What ever you went through it would have been worse if you were black. Enjoy your good life now.
"After the death of a feminist icon, I’m reminded of those who paved my path

Which ones are those? 

The women subjugated like dogs by the Muslim religion?
The millions of mutilated Muslim girls and women who you never mention?
You seem to be locked in a time warp where the women who need help are left without a voice as you white trash lesbians rage against the mythical machine. 
Instead of helping those that need it.
They are too small for you apparently
The war against the white male by the white and black feminists movement which infiltrated all walks of power and turned themselves into the bigots and racists we all despise?
All you have ever been is hateful white trash who see evil everywhere.
It is you not Trump who needs to be shamed.
You are hypocrites and sociopaths

Anyway rationalize away if you dare"
"Why is it not attempted murder? This is nothing. And I think they should water bord to get that teen to talk of the others that was with him!! Wtf!!! So tired of these young kids these days. No morals, no respect, no punishment!! Hell I was arrested at 19 for telling s black cop he was being racist. Thrown into jail one night and stood in front of a judge who handed me my punishment and said. If I did not do it I would be arrested again and would be put in jail for 3 to 6 months. And that was just saying something to s cop. It's bull shit how things are now. Granted I never went back to Jail , never been arrested since then. I learn my lesson ."
Dude gotta ask where in hawaii did you watch the older men drop the n word and boy when talking about blacks. been livin here a long time and in the 60s weren't no blacks but a few military who'd kick yer butt if ya called em boy. what you smokin dude.
Have you heard Milo speak.  He is a gay man whose likes black men.  I don't agree with everything he says but I at least listen.
"cont.
.... clear case of Racial Profiling By the Police!  =:-o   (By damn, it doesn't get much worse than that!)

Oh, and on the 'no excuses' meme, here is a very interesting academic paper from the early Obama years with some pertinent examples of how many *black Americans* were saying it was 'no excuses' time for ... black Americans.  ;-)   The scholars frankly concluded that in fact, black Americans still had plenty of excuses for personal failure (although they had to employ a lot of rather weak ""yeah - but!"" arguments, in my view).  :-/   I'd be interested on your take of this (also shared with Mr. Skeexix):  http://web.utk.edu/~blouis2/files/No%20More%20Excuses.pdf

Thanks for your words."
I think they need to stick this little weirdo into the blackest prison in the state and the guards should take 1 hour off for lunch.
The murder of transgenders this year has been one of black men killing black transgenders.  Great denial out there in GLBT and BLM community on this problem.
"Haha what a bunch of anti-semantics, I bet if she were black, everyone on this forum would be calling the security guard a nazi."
"You mean that laughable double standard where ""blacks"" and ""Jews"" have historically oppressed ""whites""? Yeah, so laughable."
"You're confusing ""a"" problem with ""the"" problem. Certainly black poverty, and the sick culture that has grown up around it, is a problem. But racist pigs that continue to stand up for the confederacy and what it stood for are also part of the problem."

Boy the elites are throwing everything they have at white people this weekend

You people never even mentioned the 30+ people dead and 100's injured by immigrants in Europe or is that just manifest destiny of the Muslims or maybe it's black Lives Matter's right to blow crap up.."
"Another black racist raised on hate history.  Does she know that the first slave owner in america was a black plantation owner?  Also, a large percentage of slave owners were black.  Of you read “real” history you might know that.  Most slaves after being captured by black Africans and sold to white slave traders were sent to South America, Central America, and the islands in the Caribbean.  Approximately 2% were sent to North America.  Those are “facts”, not left wing progressive propaganda."
"Well it's nice to know that if I ever really hate somebody, I get one mostly-free murder. As long as I'm acting like a moron, I'm not a black man, and it's an ""accident."""

"Maher is the perfect person to do just the opposite of what he does and says.  He is the model of what NOT to do.  Funny?  Yeah, he is very funny sometimes.  But he hides behind his being a ""comedian"" whenever he goes too far and gets in trouble, which is pretty often.  His racist comments recently about blacks is just one of many things he wished he never said.  Atheist, socialist, racist and hypocrite is the way to describe him in my opinion.  I'll bet he was pummeled as a kid by just about everyone, even the girls.  I can see him running all over the school playground with a bunch of people wanting to kick his butt for saying stupid things!!  On his show if the audience doesnt laugh at his sick jokes he gets mad.  LOL!  That says it all in my opinion."
"Wow.  Nice work civil comments team.

If you replaced the word ""black"" where you used the word ""white,"" that would be one of the most racist comments I have read in this day and age.  

Oh wait, this comment is verifiably racist, while trying to disparage right wingers!!!

Liberalism is certifiably a mental disorder."
Black garbage

"Donald Trump is a world class a**hole, racist pile of crap. Has to stir the pot with N Korea, refuses to acknowledge PR and the USVI, tells black athletes they don't have first amendment rights after calling them sons of *itches, supports nazi protest in NC, calls mexicans murderers rapists?

I quit watching NBA because of him and the Seattle Seahawks version of the NBA-GS Warriors! They're friggn racists and I'm DONE! Only college football for me until......let's unite and boycott the NFL/NBA!!! ESPN is dying too thank the lord.....RACIST LIBTARDS

WHEN, precisely, did President Trump Ever Call blacks ""N***** s"" ?"
"I think individuals care more than our governments do.  When I think of the conditions inside that country--the starvation due to mismanagement and corruption, the state sponsored--or required--of family members spying on each other and reporting the smallest infractions that often lead to death sentences, horrible work camps, it makes me ill.. A satellite map of the world shows a black hole at night where North Korea should be.  And that fat psychotic killer with the bad hair killing his own relatives in the most horrendous ways is absolutely sickening.  The North Korean people will never be able to mount a revolution due to being absolutely repressed and brainwashed. Heard an inteview with an escapee who had been forced to kill his own mother.  They have no idea what the outside world is even like.   Christopher Hitchens prior to his trip to NK said he refused to use the term ""Orwellian.""  Once there he said he had no choice--it is indeed an Orwellian nightmare."
"This guy is racist and bigoted and xenophobic and will punish blacks. Lol jk figured I'd be the first to throw out some labels. This guy had no problem sentencing a white supremacist leader to death and jailing his accomplice to life. Let me guess though lefties that was so he could become the next grand dragon. This guy is on record saying he has and will hold everyone accountable for there actions, white, black, red, purple. Doesn't matter to him. I'm hoping he wipes out all those pedophiles in high power and hangs them in the streets. My fav part of the article was democrats whining about illegal immigrants not getting due process. Your bloody there illegally. You get no due process and no American rights. Your rights and due process were left behind in the country you left. Fair voting rights for minorities? This guy wanted voter ID laws. Is that really an unreasonable request. Why wouldn't you want citizens having to show ID To vote. So awesome to watch the dems try to suck it up."
"Don't be ridiculous. He was armed and attacking the officers. It wouldn't matter if he was Black, White, Asian etc. Get a grip on yourself and stop trying to stir up mess where there is none."
"Are you defending Trump? If so, you have poor judgement. Also, who gives a f**k how she dresses? How do you dress? What's your job? Not only did she become a Congresswoman, despite hardships of being black and a woman, she is standing up for our Fallen. I'd say look at yourself before you judge others. She deserves some respect."
"Huh? The Left ain’t got nothing on the African American Left. 
This is the most radical ground of hateful, the ends justify the means, nasty, bigoted group of legislators EVER. Talk about racism. They’re all elitist anti Semites to begin with.

He got off easy cuz hes a black dude. Its obvious.
"@Rich 
Perhaps those people who are so focused on defining people by their skin colour are the root cause of the ridiculousness. An article from a publication like that Globe that defines the country in that way -- ""brown"" ""white"" etc. -- is still ridiculous."

"Republicans hate the America of the 21st century. Their base hates the America of the 21st century where poorly educated white men can't make middle class incomes. Most of them want to go back to the good old days of the 1950's. Obama was the last straw for them. A black man was never supposed to be president. Science alone can't make sure that won't happen again. They can't bring back the white racist nation they miss. The only question is how many of the rest of us will they kill in their death throes. Principled conservatives need to find a new party. If they stay with the Republicans, they will own the white racist label that the rest of the GOP embraces. The GOP has spent the last 50 years recruiting white racists into the GOP. Now those white racists control the GOP. Sessions is living proof of the white racism in the core of the modern GOP, in the 21st century."

We let him and the rest of ""them"" know that we're not going to stand for their achieving equality here is OUR country....and we're going to continue to make the point with white supremacy and white nationalism rallies....we'lll show ""them"" who's still boss in this country.""  

This is satire....but, unfortunately it could be actually written by the white supremacists and white nationalists who sponsored the Charlettesville protest.  The folks digust me....and, frankly sir, your posts disgusts me as well.  Gary Crum"
"What has blaming others actually done to improve the situation in the black community?  Blaming white privilege and bad cops and the laundry list of other grievances isn't getting it done.  The fact is, proven by history, the only way for the black community to get out of this malaise is to own it and fix it from within.  I don't need to get ""woke.""  They need to stop making excuses for people who do stupid stuff."

"Trump is quite the hypocrite.

If you subsitute Blacks or Muslims for the neo-Nazis, Trump would have sent in the National Guard, who would have pepper-sprayed and shot them. Then, he would have declared martial law and had every Black and Muslim person arrested if they were out after dusk."

"If he were black, they would have just shot and killed him."
"Yeah, poor oppressed bigots, can't get a hateful word edgewise because those black people have had all the power for so long. The NAACP has always been such an unfair shortcut to wealth and power.  It's just so unfair that people should drown out Nazis, racism, and white supremacy. 

The first amendment says congress can't make laws to stop them from speaking. It doesn't say anybody has to listen.  Complain about violence if you want, and I'll agree with you. But peaceful protest? I hope no Nazi bigot ever gets a quiet respectful crowd again."
"You're completely wrongheaded. Obama never called NFL players ""sons of bitches"" or publicly supported the KKK and Neo-Nazis. The protests are bigger now because the pushback against Kapernick's original protest is bigger now. Most importantly, you let your bias show in your last line my friend.. don't ever call people 'Blacks' or 'Whites': those are adjectives, not nouns. They are ""Black People"" or ""White People"" but People is the definitive word in the sentence. That's the subject. Once you drop the 'people' off a colour, you're actually relinquishing your own personhood and whether you like it or not you are now a racist. Don't let how something looks distract you from what it is. Find the noun and find your humanity again brother, it's that simple."
"well said Stubble!  Hate the religion, not the person.  Absolutely nothing wrong with hating a religion.  And heck nothing wrong with hating a hateful person.

This guy is obviously just an insane fool. And the way he goes about his goal of killing blacks is as inefficient as possible. Looks like he wanted to kill as  few people as possible and and get most attention.
Time for statistic: a black man in the USA is EIGHTEEN times more likely to murder a policeman than a policeman is to kill a black man for any reason.  It looks like cops lives matter should be the mantra.

"This article is pure bunk.  The democrats work hard every day to make blacks believe republicans will kill their children via the police.

Sorry Pitts, you dems lose the election, you lose foreign policy America bashing and surrendering, you lose teachers union bribes, and you already lost the miners and steelworkers with your cronies sucking at the government teat of overpriced solar/wind power."
"You must be wondering why blacks didn't find this country and import white slaves. Had they done that, we wouldn't have this problem. No, we'd have the opposite problem. Blacks would be complaining about whites and their inner city crime problems. And whites would be complaining about dirty black cops profiling them. 

Are you mystified that crime exists? It seems like you are. Regardless, crime doesn't excuse crime, so just because blacks are committing crime doesn't give police the right to commit crime. I know it's tempting, but don't do it. Do you understand?"
Lol! That's why the mostly white team owners directed Trump to pop off with his insult so that they can then direct their black players to pull this little stunt in response. Gotta watch for 'em they'll trick ya every time!!! I say it's the North Koreans!!!

"Trump is a racist sympathizer.
He single-handedly used his wealth and fame to perpetuate the lie – wholly racist in nature – that President Obama was not born in the United States.
He has declared his intention to deport millions of law-abiding Muslims, ban immigration of Muslims, and has called Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists.
He openly accepted the support of avowed white supremacists during his campaign and has done virtually nothing to distance himself from these groups and their political aims since.
The neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups that marched in Charlottesville are similarly transparent in their purpose.
They believe in the supremacy of white European Christians over, well, everyone else.
In particular, they want to eliminate Jews and Blacks, and Latinos, Muslims, LGBTQ folks, feminists (perhaps women, generally), Catholics, and many others.

"You're accusing ME of not valuing human life ?

I understand that kind of harassment is legal and accepted in Alaskan native villages apparently, but it's not right on a human or a Christian level ( which is apparently not their religion). Sooo he is  wearing a knife on his belt on a small farm in Alaska and that makes him a bad person? Hahaha. That's beautiful."

"Mr. Trump has chosen to manufacture a problem that doesn't exist inside a private business.  He's doing this, again, to deflect attention away from the fact that his administration is a failed mess.  His sad supporters and sycophants are easily distracted, and this is the latest shiny ball to roll by them.

It doesn't seem to dawn on his supporters that Trump is an infantile failure.

Now he has picked a fight with black athletes, and has additionally insulted their mothers.  Trump is a racist piece of garbage who is soiling the presidency and White House every day he remains in office.  Worst President Ever.  By a wide margin."

I sure as hell know and they know that our countries have messed it up royally . So then why, why do women want to lower themselves to cover up there faces when facing the world?  Why and what are they ashamed of.  Why don’t they offer us the courtesy of seeing them when engaging us in conversation?  Why live with rules that date black to ancient times. Are they afraid of there men still. Baffles my mind.   I am a male that came from that backward culture and these people make me wonder why they come here but live in the same stupid backwards world they wanted so desperately to leave."

depends on who you label a terrorist.  Dylan Roof was a terrorist.  The white guy who killed the Indian man in the US was a terrorist.  The white guy who killed a black guy in NYC because he was black is a terrorist.  Who gives a damn what you call it?

Only in so far as it shows hate for minorities and the vulnerable.

How would an atheist Commie know how anyone prays anyway?  Answer, you don’t.  
It seems like you have more in common with Kim Jong-un than anyone living here, other than your fellow neo-coms. You should all kiss the ground that is called America because she tolerates and protects idiots and fools as well as the rest of us. She protects you even though you detest her. Try your negative rants against Cuba, Venezuela or North Korea there at 1/2 the volume and find out what the “land of the free” means.  

BTW: Compare the kill rate of Blacks by inner city cops to that of Blacks by inner city Black gangs. Stop lying about the cops and solve the gang problem if you believe BLM."
"Brigitta, have you been paying attention to Donald Trump's rhetoric? He began his campaign questioning whether our first black president was actually born in this country?  He has issued non-stop white supremacist dog whistles at his rallies about ""dangerous"" blacks and immigrants.  He was enthusiastically supported by the KKK's David Duke, who celebrated his promise to ""Take America Back.""  The first of Donald's three wives, Ivana, said that he kept a copy of Hilter's speeches in his bed table. His father was a Klan member. He has selected a known white supremacist, Steve Bannon,  to be his Chief Strategist.  The FBI has already reported a sharp increase in the number of  hate crimes against Muslims, Jews, immigrants and other minorities from those emboldened by his rhetoric. These people  are afraid for their safety.  He has also degraded & demeaned women on a regular basis. Wake up!

All black people support Obama because he is black?  That's not true. All people who support Trump are racist, deplorable, rich and stupid?  That's not true. Give me a break.

"political correctness can be right-winged too. For example, you can't criticize cops, Israel, capitalism, the USA, or religion. They can be just as intolerant, if not worse. 
Trump's birther thing was caused by his immense jealousy: that a black man with a muslim father, who grew up in various parts of the world, was  the president when HE wasn't. I doubt it was racism. Trump is a petulant adolescent."

It's tragic so many Clintonites like you Paul ignored all the baggage and the lies and the record that made their candidate such a terrible one and have in turn given the GOP and Trump the best chance for victory.

"Sadly, Trump is the preferred leader of the GOP base of ""poorly educated"" white folks that he claims to love. He expresses their fear and rage. They are  terrified of losing the white privilege they claim does not exist. They are also the only demographic  in the country that is dying younger. They are killing themselves with drugs, alcohol, domestic violence, and suicides.  I would pity them if they didn't think killing black folks would solve their problems."

Got to love Trump.  No more red carpet from the Kenyan illegal idiot!  The illegal Oidiot has no roots in this country from his black half.  We need to deport him too!
"This was never about defying Trump, this was always about ignorance on the part of the black players.  The Broncos management is as stupid as they are.  I emailed them a week ago to say just that.  

For myself and apparently many others, we no longer give a crap about the blacks or their grievances.  The nfl and the Broncos will lose this battle , as they have already lost me and those many others who see it as anti-American, unpatriotic display.  Go join blm and march on YOUR time, not mine.  The Broncos are as much to blame as the other nfl owners."
"Aussies really are prejudiced. Real bastardos. They hate the Indians, Aborigines, blacks, and Asians. Don't even try to talk to them. Had lots of fun yelling back at them. So many sex perverts that they passed a law forbidding pedophiles from leaving Australia. More Aussie tourists die in Thailand than any other destination. Why?"
"Kermit Gosnell, a black man, is the most prolific serial killer in American history."
"Black people kill more Black people than all the whites, hispanics and Asians put together--maybe when Black people start showing some respect for the lives of their fellow man then maybe they can earn some payback in kind"
"I know!!! I died laughing my ass off!! This is a first. Don't you hold the gun at the teller and demand the teller dumps the money in the bag?? OMG - too bad the teller was a cute little white girl. We needed an older black Southern Gramma who would have picked up the gun and said ""You stupid boy! I should whip your ass you so stupid! You know your momma raised you better than this!!"" As she beats the gunman over the head with his own weapon and his partner slinks out in shame ...."
"Oh Nick you seem to be missing the most comical aspect of these dumb football players.  They don't want to deal with the real and much bigger issue of black on black crime as that won't help their mindless leader Colin ""half white"" Kaepernick get a job in the NFL.  This is the real sport...watching these fools look silly!"
"There are liars, damn liars and then there are statistics!

""as Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota, told us back in February. ""Whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.""

Blacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. Police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along.""

"Attention Readers: ONLY black readers should heed the NCAAP warning for American Airlines.  Every other color of person is not allowed to be forewarned or even mildly alarmed.  ONLY black people may feel any different towards said airline, not whites or any other race."
None of that would ever have happened if he weren't black.  What do you mean?

"Protesting the national anthem, because you think all cops are racist pigs who kill blacks based on color, is like refusing to drink Gatorade, because you think coffee growers are killing bean pickers in the fields. One has absolutely nothing to do with the other. If you want to protest police policy, why not go to the station with signs? 

This all started when the racist, BLM cop hater Kaepernick wore socks with cartoon pigs wearing police uniforms. BLM is a parade of lies. Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown were both killed during violent assaults. Hands up don't shoot was a huge lie.

If BLM and their uninformed followers really cared about black lives, they would be marching through the big city ghettos trying to stop blacks from slaughtering other blacks. See Chicago. A black person in America is more likely to be killed by other black person than any other group, BY FAR. And cops are more likely to be killed by blacks than the other way around. The truth can hurt sometimes."
"race on the mainland is taken to the extremes,  whites is whites and blacks is black and no respect for each other with the extremes .   blacks protesting are the criminals protecting black criminals.  they have too."

"Indeed, millions of racist rants have been posted since President Obama's election.  Never has a President been so attacked.  You speak about 'failed policies'..OK, address those policies.  Don't, as so many over the eight years of President Obama's presidency had done, attack him because he's a black man.  Don't as did Donald Trump assert that he isn't even a native born American.  

You brand criticism of the actions of ""white conservative males"" as racist.  If I read or hear what I consider a racist comment, indeed I will confront it.  If,  as I've had happen, a white conservative starts a conversation about President Obama with ""that stupid N$#$%^"", indeed I will confront it...be guaranteed of that.  

Dishonest media!!! Fake News!!! In fact the news media works hard to keep politicians, including Mr. Trump, honest.  When a Trump lie is exposed, his standard response is ""fake news""....""dishonest media"""".. Mr. Trump hasn't ""owned"" even ONE of the hundreds of his lies... So sad  GC"

"Before you troll me, just read the whole comment. A 17 year old white high school girl saying stupid racist shit makes headlines in this Country. But it's cool to be racist as long as you're pumping money into the dirty, kfc covered finger lickin good hands of the ANC, and to demonize white people and divide our fragile nation even further. The entire ""White Monopoly Capital"" agenda from these dip-shits has caused so much division and hatred in this country that the true cost cannot be fully accounted. This is for me, apart from the looting of our state, a bigger problem than all their other crimes. They've divided SA once again. The GUPTAS(!!!????!!!) have turned back the clock, together with Duduzani the IDIOT, on 23 years of all of us, white, black, indian, coloured trying desperately to get along for all these years. So lets focus on the real issues as a nation, and not create sensational headlines by blowing isolated incidences of racism out of proportion."
"Apparently ESPN thinks the way to getting a black audience is by hiring racist black sportscasters. Frankly, they're probably right."
"Uh, why would i want to do that, it's bad enough being black."
"I'm curious, are most whites killed by whites?  Asians by Asians?  Have you looked at the stats on other colors, or are you just fixated on blacks?"
Why even put the complaints of a ranting black woman in the news.  She was kick off the plane for being a loud obnoxious passenger.  Nothing to do with the color or her skin.  Absurd!

"No Mr Summers, black people who hate Jews could not fit in with Nazis.

Why are most of the people blacks choose to represent them such idiots? Frederica Wison? Come on everyone. She is a clown. Rev. Sharpton? Come on everyone. He is an idiot.

"How much respect do certain people on this forum give to black citizens, Outsider? Very damn little. I find your 2 cents to be hypocritical.

I know many of you are capable of that."
So funny. Classical joke where blacks can't recognize a blackface actress. Proved whites ARE smarter than blacks. Made for good fodder for SNL.
"When's the BLM rally to protest the shooting of unarmed black people? Oh yeah, I forgot that black lives only seem to matter when the shooter is white. When the shooter is black,  we just ignore the situaion and move on."
"""It's certainly no because of an advertising blitz""?  Fear and terrorism propaganda filling the media at all levels on a daily basis.  The election of a black man to Presidency  generated huge sales as the NRA and its White Supremacist associates filled every corner of the nation with claims that Obama was going to take away all of the guns.  Insane fear generated by nothing but hot air as the gun makers and distributors couldn't supply enough arms or ammunition.  The greatest surge of civilian gun buying in the history of the nation.  The statistical numbers certify my point.  All of that armament for what?  None of it has stopped the killing on the streets.  Just stupid."
Give a rest you old communist fool.  Florida and Texas have large populations of blacks and Hispanics.
"Thanks to the worlds media demonizing police, insinuating they hate blacks and go out of their way to shoot/arrest them, that's why the crazies work themselves up to do these things, to be martyrs for what they believe in their crazy heads"
"Right.  Couldn't have anything to do with the fact that he is a black man in a state that is still willing to fly the colors of traitor slaveholders. He just happens to have the tools and means to do something about it, unlike most others there."
"Ok, congress. He signed the resolution condemning white supremacists.  Now get him the resolutions condemning racist black groups, violent leftist groups, property damaging social justice warrior groups (sorry, redundant).

Yes but Malcolm X and his most recent successor believe that blacks need to live apart from the white devils.
"Sherman was a psychopathic murderer and a war criminal.  On his orders, tens of thousands of unarmed Southerners -both black and white- were killed, women were raped, crops and livestock were stolen, homes were burnt to the ground, non-combatants were tortured and imprisoned....and you feel that he deserves a statue. Sherman was one of the most vile war criminals of all time. Only those who are ignorant of history could eulogize him."
dumass got himself killed. now we have to go through the because im black excuse. cops have no idea what he reached into his truck for. idiot should have laid down soon as the guns came out. you dont ignore cops or anyone with a gun drawn. stupid idiot would still be here if he knew how to listen. his own damn fault no pity from me. good ridance.

"Funny how you can be so offended by a restaurant name, but not give a rat's ass about a ""comedian"" who has made a career of tired racist and homophobic BS.  It sure is fun for white people to be able to gather and not feel guilty about laughing out loud at stuff like this....and it being ""ok"" solely because it is coming from a funny black guy."
"People are scared of black people because black people can be violent & they will probably beat you up if you annoy them. So I have rarely seen whites or Asians being openly, verbally racist to black people. 

But I did hear my white female high school classmate say something nasty to a black girl who was a nice, polite, friendly girl, not the type of girl who would beat you up.

I have seen white & black people harass, bully & saying racist things to Asians or saying racist things about Asians.

I have seen Asians being nasty to Asians, Asians saying nasty things to Asians, Asians saying nasty things about Asians.

Asians are easy targets for racists & bullies because Asians are less likely to beat you up or talk back to you if you harass them.

Most likely, you will see acts of racism against Asians & Muslim looking people.

Blacks face discrimination & prejudice in school, looking for job, looking to rent a home.

There have been news reports of racist white people attacking blacks."
"So the protestors are racist,  how,  exactly?

Its sad you're so triggered by the horrid injustice of hearing a black man's opinion."
"OMG! Stop the presses! The WH fires its chief usher.  She's a black, immigrant, woman and gay.  How disgusting.  How can Trump do such a thing.  I heard Trump personally fired her.  Next he's going to fire the WH gardener.  What is going on?  Let's organize and protest and riot in the streets!  Hawaii needs to file a lawsuit."
"Right, so why don't you just state what type of animal you think blacks are? You characterize human beings as less than farm animals. RACIST POS."
The cop killed Brown in cold blood because he was black. That's a lie.
"What we really need to squelch are under-informed and over-opinionated cop-haters who bash cops in knee-jerk fashion when they kill a violent perpetrator, like the hate group Black LIES Matter does."

"Based on the widely circulated eye-witness account of the (himself armed) guitarist Caleb Keeter - in which he recanted his life-long opposition to gun control after BEING in that situation and finding his own gun useless. 

This was a country music show in America. Country music - the stuff gun nuts all listen to, the stuff they blare when they walk into family restaurants with an AR-15 slung to their backs and say they are excercising their ""rights""*. There were probably more guns in the crowd than in Paddock's hotel room.

*I put rights in quotes because even in America you don't have a right to carry a gun onto somebody else's private property without their permission. Open-Carry laws don't actually mean the owner of the local McDonalds has to allow you to scare kids with your massive penis-extension hanging out. Indeed, any SANE restaurant owner would call the cops thinking he is about to be the victim of an armed robbery - and if a black man does it, you KNOW he will."
"""Racial profiling""?

You mean like EPD arresting the two black guys who drove all the way from Southern California for kidnapping and robbery in the marijuana operation?

Or arresting the black guy who just killed the female black cop sitting in the police van back East? 

That kind of racial profiling?    It isn't my fault that black people commit more crimes proportionate to their numbers than white people. 

If they drive a thousand miles to commit felonies and get caught, they are just stupid; color is irrelevant.

And one of them still has his felony hold from California.

Your beloved President Obama's District Director of the EPA was fired for her part in ignoring the Flint crisis, as you appear to want  to forget.

She didn't care about all those 'childrun'!  She was living high on the hog as an Obama appointee and couldn't be bothered to do the job she was being paid to do."
Yawn. You think Hillary Clinton isn't racist? If you do you are a fool. She accepted a $20k check from the KKK for her campaign. She was caught on video making a racist comment about Mexicans. She went to a college costume party in black face. Get your head out of the sand! Mr. Trump is not racist. That is liberal lies!
"""when Oregonians, thankfully, overwhelmingly rejected it.""

Oregonians rejected it, and that's a good thing, but it's mitigated a bit by the fact the Oregon also made it illegal for blacks to be in the state, punishable by a public whipping (39 lashes) every six months until they left.

That is the primary reason why Oregon is one of the whitest states in the nation."
"Hillary is 100% correct! Her loss had NOTHING to do with the fact she was an awful candidate, a corrupt venal entitled puppet for Wall Street, an arrogant presumptuous psychopath, a two-faced lying hypocrite, none of these factors had ANYTHING to do with her loss--Why? you might ask--BECAUSE all these characteristics were obvious to all in the DNC who anointed her as the NEXT ""identity"" to become royalty--black, then female, apparently was the order of coronation by the Left--

The Media had already prepared their glossy covers with her crown in place--

The media still betrayed her--They could NOT ignore (as they had intended) the Republican candidate despite their orders--Trump played them like PT Barnum and they dutifully kept him FRONT and CENTER in the headlines--even trying to ridicule him as they did, Trump's name was in the news daily and the ""deplorables"" (those ignored by the mainstream parties) who were themselves ""mad as hell"" voted their disgust of party politics--hah, hah"
"Isn't this the old hag who said all women who don't vote for Hillary with go to hell?

She doesn't even know the Brandenburg gate fell so long ago.
Sleeping in till noon at her dacha by the lake she assumed the Communist Party finally took over cause some black guy was President.....

Hillary was a shoe-in cause who would dare defy the Goddess!! 

Then of course all those deadbeat billions which now are wasted on 50% of the Canadian and US population that won't work but suck at the throat of the taxpayer cry that she is s goddess....

"There is only one man in Washington who has the .....backbone to speak the truth. The fascist Antifa and Racist Black lives mater came ready to fight and that's what they did. Supporting history and noble men whether you agree with them or not does not make someone (as the current marxist lies would infer) a racist. They had the right to peacefully do that and they did, BLM and Antifa do not have the right to beat people up and shout them down, it is they who have blood on their hands as much as the driver. Trump support grows with the people with every swing he takes at these idiots who call themselves reporters but who are in reality just the new face of Pravda"

Your greatest achievement was managing to be born white."
"Before you do that IDIOT and DISRESPECT thing, supposedly this is ALL for blacks killed by Police. THINK about the FACTS that ALL but ONE ( that officer sentenced to life in prison ), were killed while in the commission of yet ANOTHER FELONY, ALL RESISTED arrests, NONE HAD THEIR hands up, NONE NONE NONE, ONLY ONE had fewer that EIGHT prior FELONY CONVICTIONS, including the PUNK THUG in La. who was convicted of RAPING THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL. Think of those FACTS."
"But does anyone ever share 100% of your values?  I saw a video of someone walking through the streets of NYC asking people who claimed to be Hillary voters who said a particular quote, Hillary or Trump, then a somewhat shocking quote was read.  Almost everyone attributed it to Trump, yet they were Hillary quotes.  I take those things with a grain of salt because you never know how they are edited, but Hillary was anti-gay marriage until it became politically expedient for her in the past couple of years.  Hillary's campaign staff started the Obama birther controversy.  Hillary called black men ""Super Predators"".  I could go on.  Don't mistake this as me suggesting Trump has never done similarly stupid things, but are they really ""values"" if people are willing to set them aside to support a political party?"
John you are so racist!!

"The Jones Act was immediately lifted to help Texas and Florida.

"Obama is the racist.

When white racist Dylann Roof tragically murdered nine black Christians in Charleston, South Carolina, 
Obama said:   “The motivations of the shooter remind us that racism remains a blight that we have to combat together.” 
 
Yet, when homosexual black racist Vester Lee Flanagan, whose alias was “Bryce Williams” during his failed career in journalism, viciously gunned down a reporter, Alison Parker, and a cameraman, Adam Ward, only because they were white,  Obama said:  “The number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism.”

The outcome? They want someone in power who will make sure blacks will never be in charge of their state, they want someone in charge to make sure gays will never be treated like human beings in their state. It goes back to their lynching days where they would Lynch a black man without evidence just to appease the ignorant redneck populace.

Just another reason along with their lopsided justice, crappy food (used to be the best burgers in Town not any more), pathetic service, (last time I went to Spur a year ago it took three waiters before I got one that spoke English I could understand), to boycott them. This proves that they do not care 1 bit for the safety and well being of children, they do nothing when kids get slapped, but shout at a black person and BAM your banned, and now they let kids into smoking areas............ DISGUSTING."
"So by your definition, Whites are racists but nobody else is? OK then, since the Blacks have the NAACP then if whites have the NAAWP it is racist for the Whites but not the Blacks? Grow up Kenny! There are no Slaves or Slaveholders alive today, so blaming whites for misdeeds of the past is liking beating the neighbor's dog even though your dog is the one that urinated on the flowers!"

"Wow. Just because you don't side completely with the antifa side, you're a white racist, even though you're not white. Ha ha. Alt right baloney. Before Trump got elected, nobody even heard of alt right. Now everything racist is alt right. Actually everything now days is racist, that's how stupid the left is. You progressive liberals are the alt left. So far to the left, you've fallen off a cliff. This is the way I look at it. There are white hate groups that don't like you cause of color or religion. There are hate groups on the left that don't like you because you don't think like they do. BLM is a group that hates you if you are not black. I don't like any of them, period. I support Trump and if you call me a racist, you're just plain ignorant."
"Of course it is about money for the NFL owners you dimwitted idiot! And soon it is going to be about money for the players when the networks slash the money they are paying to the league. How long do you think the average Joe would be employed if he walked around at his job fist in the air bellyaching to customers about social injustice? I think what 87% of America is learning is that blacks are never going to be happy. They can be making millions playing sports, making violent angry noise or as President and they are going to be obsessed with police doing their jobs. Instead of questioning why 13% of the population commits over half of murders they focus on a tiny handful of police shootings. The ten or so clearly unjustified police shootings of blacks each year hardly is indicative of a major problem. The millions of crimes committed each year by blacks is. The 72% of black children born out of wedlock is. There is your social injustice Brandon."
"what social injustice???? Blacks LOOTING, BLACKS MURDERING OTHER BLACKS MORE THAN ANY WHITE HAS EVER KILLED BLACKS IN ALL HISTORY OF USA......Chicago, 1,000 Black-killing-black murders a year for 50 years, then add Detroit, St. Louis, New Orleans, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, LA--AND THAT IS MORE BLACKS KILLING EACH OTHER SINCE THE 70s THAN ALL THE ""slaves"" BROUGHT TO AMERICA..... It isn't White Cops killing Blacks that is the SOCIAL INJUSTICE."

The left is the bastion of hatred and intolerance."

It doesn't matter how much of an embarrassment he makes of himself and the country. It doesn't matter how often he brings us to the brink of actual nuclear war. It doesn't matter how much economic damage he does to his own base. It doesn't matter that he takes to Twitter and obsesses over things like people kneeling at football games when Puerto Rico is still mostly without power.


None of this matters, because much of his base are so nihilist that they don't even care if they are getting battered by his policies, as long as they think the ""blahs"", the women, the gays, non-xtians, the liberals, etc., are getting it worse and if they think tRump is erasing the black president's legacy.


A core of deplorables will stick with him because he pisses off what they perceive to be ""liberals"" - i.e., anyone who is not dumb/hateful enough to have voted for this moron."
"Ok, let's use #1.  If a White person panders to Black people because of a presumed superiority of White people because of, e.g., long-term effects of slavery, then it's racism.  See?

Answer: Mainly because blacks had not come up anywhere in this discussion, but also because I didn't think either of us would want to go there.

"Blacks aren't going to vote for Bob Young. Most blacks are ignorant people. They will never empower themselves. After all, blacks joined the party of the KKK in 1932, when the Grand Wizard was the head of the DNC. That's like Jews joining the Nazi party. And blacks have been used by democrats ever since. Don't believe me, ask Malcolm X. He knew democrats were using blacks for their votes."
"And no, screw ""densification"" and carbon footprints.  I'm not gonna freeze in the dark just because niggers and Pakis won't keep their pants up."
These politicians that pull the race card need to be put down. Promoting hate seems to be the new black experience.
"Who would want to waste their time on meeting her.  She is one of the biggest liars and racists in Congress today.  As for not having black dolls, I'm in my 80's and they had black dolls when I was a child.  Shame on her for another falsehood."
"no doubt but what good does only my understanding do if the races commitin the crimes won't bother trying to understand and work either? you think I'm racist and to a degree i'll give you credit but it is only because of the black people I've met and known. Only 10 of 100 I know would I introduce to my friends and family, the others belong in halfway houses. The first people to beg me to help them steal with them were black, the first con on the run I met was black, the first person to admit to me he stole all the food he ever ate in this state was black. The first people I know to kill and be killed over a pair of shoes were both black. And lastly the first bank robbers of the year at this spot were black! Grow up, in all ways!"

"Many of the commenters these days are not worth reading or responding too. When you continually use ""buffoon"", ""orange man"", ""bozo"" to describe the president is the United States of America, you are no bettter than some one who used the ""N"" word, ""monkey"" or ""black man"" to describe our past president. You are just as racist. Pathetic."
"Yeah, It's somewhat speculation as to what the deeper motivations of large numbers people to vote for(or against) him were. I just find it interesting that so many call him the ""black"" president, and ignore the ""white"" half like it doesn't exist(incredibly some nitwits actually called Bill Clinton the first ""black"" president). I think it's due in some part to a desperate desire to prove the US isn't as racially divided as it is. 
I'm somewhat aware of the cultural history of slavery with it's tiered descriptions of racial mix, there were probably at least a half dozen categories IIRC.

He is a cringing coward expecting other councilors  to do his dirty work. He is afraid BLM will rally thousands of Black youth and gangs to riot all over downtown again.    He doesn't want to be held accountable for that so he smiles and sells out the gay community.

"We understand why they THINK they are treated unfairly but are they really? If there were not so many black criminals, then they would not get 'profiled'.
1. With only 13% of the population, blacks commited 52% of homicides between 1980 and 2008, vs 45% for whites even though there are 5x more whites.
2. Between 2011 to 2013, 38.5% arrested for murder,manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault were black. That is 3x higher than the black population percentage. Worst yet, black males between 15-34 who are responsible for most of those crimes represent only 3% of the population.
3. Blacks, at 13% of the total population, commit about the same or greater number of crimes as whites, yet whites are TWICE as likely to be killed by police officers.

That the pride organisers were looking for taxpayer money, while at the same time acquiescing to the idiots at BLM, and you voted to dole out the cash regardless, shows a complete lack of political will. You caved Mayor Tory and as a result we have the embarrassment that we have on our hands today. Enjoy the blow back. You deserve it."
"Now isn't the time for platitudes. It's time to buy a gun if you aren't white and male. Trump won because of white people, including college educated whites (by 1 point). They voted for him, he's their macho man gonna make America safe for the white male pussy grabbers and Christian rapos. 
Ultimately it was all that pent up rage at having an educated black man for president for 8 years. It's literally jealousy. Jealousy that some black people have moved up the economic ladder. The ignorant undereducated whites just popped their pills and drank themselves into a stupor while non-whites got competitive. 
Trump is the president for white people. The white supremacist heartland (and rustbelt) have spoken. The whites have fallen into line and are ready to do the bidding of the 1% even against their own self-interest because they are first and foremost racist."
"Errrr that's entirely the point, Brady.  When a black person is implicated in these articles, the commentariat (the ignorant white male commentariat, that is) goes nuts like ""oooooo SEEEEEEE?

"Because its hate against White people. Only works if you are a minority, gay ect....ever hear of the WET (White entertainment tv) nope, not politically correct but its ok to have the BET (Black entertainment tv). How about the NAAWP( national association for the advancement of White people) nope, not politically correct but the NAAACP (national association for the advancement of Colored people) is OK. How about the congressional Black caucus...OK but its a no no to have a congressional White caucus. Its politically correct to hate White people, nothing racist about it."
"Lets see, do you know of the man who ambushed and murdered  two police officers  in Des Moines this week?   He's bigot, he's a white male, probably mentally ill, and a Donald Trump supporter.   Now If I follow the Trump logic:  The man killed two police, he is white, he supports Donald Trump, ergo either all white people are cop killers, or because he supports Donald Trump, all Trump supporters are cop killers.

Yes, it's a RIDICULOUS conclusion.    Yes, it is the SAME strategy that Trump uses against immigrants and black citizens who he accuses of being cop killers and rapist.     He doesn't stop at the individual, he fans the flame of hatred/fear against an entire culture/race and uses it for his own self promotion.   

And this is the guy who is going to bring respect to authority, his authority, no thank you."

If you think the 4 black people to tortured the white mentally handicapped person in Chicago this week are not racist than you are too blind to admit that liberal ideology invites racists the same as conservative ideology. My guess is you think because they are black surely they can't be racist. Right Gary??

Continue to use your ism's and place everyone in their own box. That's a great way to solve racism. You hate conservatives because they don't think like you. Your not fooling anyone."
This is the type of news reporting that causes people to vote for Trump.   If this was a white man shooting blacks it would be reported much differently (like the Dylan Roof case for example).
"I'm a white guy. Do not put me and Eastman in the same box. Don't do that with anyone. Calling him ""Mr. White Privilege"" shows your ignorance.

"The fact that so few Americans owned slaves just means that the rich whites, as usual, used the draft and divide and conquer strategy to get poor white Southerners to fight their Secessionist battle for them. Slave owners were able to buy their way out of service. Not poor white Southerners. Over and over in this country, white supremacy was trotted out to get poor white Americans to accept crumbs rather than unite with their fellow black Americans. Poor white Americans were used to chase escaped slaves they themselves could never afford. Poor white Americans were used to segregate and terrorize freedmen who only wanted liberty. Poor white Americans were used to enforce Jim Crow the 20th century. 

The more things change, the more they stay the same. 

The stats you cited provide even more reason to toss the racist divisive Confederacy into history's trash bin. Let's stop celebrating poor whites being duped to fight for slavery.

So then why, why do women want to lower themselves to cover up their faces when facing the world?  Why and what are they ashamed of.  Why don’t they offer others  the courtesy of allowing them to see their face when they engage in conversation?  Why live with rules that date black to ancient times. Are they afraid of there men still. Baffles my mind.

Blacks have often poor eating and life style habits which leads to them having more health problem than other races. Is saying anything true but mentioning race nowadays racist ?

"Fake news in America has a birthday the Pope and Hillary Clinton should know .  August 8, 2014 is when the big lie ""Hands Up Don't Shoot"" started about a 282 ib 6' 5""  Black thug Brown who has just committed a felony and was reported by the media as shot in the back unarmed by a white police officer by ABC, CNN, CBS, NBC, NYT etc etc.... Well the truth is that several Black witnesses told a grand jury under oath said Brown had charged and assaulted the police officer and tried to take the officer's gun, and was shot in self defense. Then Black Lives Matter by Al Sharpton was formed based on this lie and marched chanting ""Fry 'em like bacon. Put the pigs in a blanket. What do we want now? Dead cops!"" While the Black racists got there way. To date this year 25 police officers have been killed by Black thugs and half of them saythey were inspired by Black Lives Matter to assassinate police officers. Listen to Denzil Washington not Hillary Clinton or Comrade Pope,"

If, indeed, the ""battle has already been won"", could you please tell the white supremacists/white nationalists and ask them to quit working for their goals of racial supremacy.  BTW: You ascribe the responsibility for violence to the ""counter-protesters"".......The most specific act of extreme violence was the driving of a car into the crowd of ""counter-protesters.""  Since many in that crowd were black (I'm guessing not many of the white supremacists/white nationalists were black), there's little doubt which ""side"" was guilty of the violence which caused serious injury and death.

Since he won the popular vote twice in the presidential election against...gasp, white guys, one must assume he aspired to be grand Poo-pa of the Universe as it can scarcely be demonstrated what higher office he could have won here on Earth.

"I would give this article a little more respect if it said 'all people' rather than 'white people'. It would seem that the author believes that only white people are capable of racism and prejudice. 
Black Lives Matter is prejudiced. They hijacked the Toronto Pride parade 2 years in a row! They care about no one but black people, but white people are encouraged to support them? They are just causing mayhem like the white supremacists or the jihadist terrorists. Sure they don't have the disgusting history, but they have to start somewhere. All these groups are steeped in hate. They all suck."
Even the loser ultra left wing black racists have the puke loser aclu's number!
"Yes I do remember that ... when Obama won you couldn't find a Republican who would admit for voting for W not once but twice.  W drove the USA economy off a freakn cliff, started 2 'off budget' wars we are still fighting today ... YET ... the ONLY thing that mattered to 'em was that there was a Black man in office and the deficit was ALL OBAMA'S FAULT ... 

The deficit ONLY matters to 'em when a Black man is in office.  Now that Cheetolini is in office, you don't hear a PEEP from Repubs about spending EXCEPT when it is spending focused on USA citizens.  All domestic spending BAD.  All war spending GOOD.  The Military Industrial Machine is FULL of eligible voters who get their paychecks from Defense contracts, the irony isn't lost of myself that many of these suburban folks in 'republican' areas consider themselves Christian ... but sh*t howdy do they pray to the alters of money and war!!! They are SICK!!!

"Oh, the poor little snowflakes... still incapable of getting over the idea that the country doesn't owe the lion's share of everything to keep them happy and comfortable. Whites are the least targeted ethnicity in the entire country - but nooo, let's claim ""victimhood"" because some white jackass in a restaurant wasn't allowed his NP-given right to use violence to protect his toxic masculinity from a black woman's words. The number of Afrikaans-speakers have been growing (which those types in the picture conveniently ignores because non-white Afrikaans speakers now outnumber white ones) - but noooo, let's claim victimhood because it doesn't get treated as if it's the only language that should be spoken in South Africa (when in reality it's still only the third most spoken language).

Really. Instead of pretending to be the ""master race"", maybe a large portion of white people in this country could actually start using what is situated in-between their ears. That would be nice."

"Yes, and all women have to do is cease being found attractive by rapists and they don't have to worry about being raped. All black people have to do in order to stop being targeted by racists is stop being black.  All transgender people have to do is quit being who they are, live a lie and they don't have to worry about being denigrated and depicted as perverts. And all you have to do, Mr. Curry, is stop posting ridiculous comments to stop torturing the rest of us."

"Nothing of what you claim is in my post.  Nothing.  A black person is obviously black to all casual observers.  Not always, but the vast majority of the time.  This fact does not apply to homosexual people.  When a bisexual person engages in homosexual activity, does this make them homosexual or do they continue to be bi?  My point is that, really, it is none of my, nor your, business.  Unless you observe the activity, or if they proclaim their sexual preferences, you have no way of discriminating against the person.  Black Americans do not have this ability to hide their status."

Stalemate. Obama is a black muslim and above reproach. trump is  white christian and open to any and all criticism.
I do understand their protest!! They hate white people so much that 16 black men lawfully shot by  white police officers in a year  is wayyyyy worse than the thousands of black on black murders and 100’s in Chicago every week..
"This sounds like Black racism to me:

Knifing and persecution of a disabled young white man because they thought he voted for Trump. 

Chicago Police say because the four black defendants shouted ""“F**k white people. F**k Donald Trump,” at their victim they will 'consider' whether that was sufficient indication that a hate crime had taken place.""

""They removed a piece of his scalp with a knife, while punching him in the face, cursing at him, threatening to “shank” him with a long knife, and forcing him to praise black people, denounce white people, and say “F**k Donald Trump.”

""Videos shot by the suspects show that they forced their captive to drink from the toilet while being beaten."""
"Trump is a total buffoon he is opening a can of worm he and the next president will never be able to undo at all he is creating a discord in his own country that will  see white gangs kill innocent american kids born on american soil if the bill goes throw.

he is handing the KKK and other white supremist  the one thing that the preious president did not give them the right to kill non  whites on american soil regardless of nationality or origins like Sikhs.Hindu,Muslim a side Blacks. mexicans. etc."

Your post with a dumb generalizationa about all the people that support the blm support reparations disapeared. You keep doubling down on dumb generalizations. Your arguement is terrible and based on dumb generalizations. You do not speak for black people. Take two weeks off then quit.
"BLM doesn't want equal treatment.  They want to be above the law.  They want to kill white cops and they want to loot towns and get free stuff.  Doesn't sound that different.  They are both hate groups.  They can say they aren't, but their actions speak otherwise."

"All I want is equal rights under the law. This country has never achieved that goal. Do you support the police murdering unarmed black folks including children? Do you enjoy being a beneficiary of that racist violence? Do you think killing a 12 year old holding an air rifle in a playground is justified? The cop that shot him was fired for lying on his job application, not murder. He is still free. How many white folks murdered by black people for political purposes would you tolerate? How many centuries of that violence would you tolerate? What would you do to stop the killing? Would peaceful protest work for you as your response? Would mere suspicion of you having a gun justify a cop killing you?"
"It is pure Ignorance to vote just for having first woman president, in same way voted just to have first black president!"
Also Ervin is pointed out as black n the story. Why didnt they point out that he is also native american or jewish? Do native americans not deserve their race to b spotlighted?!  The guy looks hispanic to me! Let others decide the race not that it matters. If the  newspaper wants to make this event about race then they should include all the races and cultures!

Criminal gangs of specific ethnicities:  Black, Hispanic and Asian respectively.

That is not a racist comment, either.  Just a recitation of the facts of life...and death."
BLM should be kicked out of Pride and march alone in Chicago in a hail of black on black gun battles. The cops were good sports to take part and Pride allowed black racists to hijack them-cowards !!
My point still stands:   you would have made a better case if you gave a few cases of people whose lives were actually destroyed by using marijuana.  You don't think people's lives have been destroyed through the judicial system?  We have too many people in jail and most is due to the war on drugs.  Shortsighted and stupid.   We need to stop funding the world's largest prison industrial complex.  And yes people have gone to jail for just smoking a joint.  They tend to be black.

"Everything Fr. Reese writes about Trump was well known before nearly 63 million people pulled the lever for him, yet they pulled the lever for him anyway. Why? Because Hillary is a liar (Trump isn't?), because Trump ""tells it like it is"" (""I like to grab 'em by the p*ssy"", ""Mexicans are rapists."") ""and because, gosh darn it, gay marriage and transgender bathrooms were a step too far and it was all Obama and Hillary's fault, and besides, black people are moochers. Oh, and abortion.""

Those people made the decision to pull the lever for Trump so they could have fun watching a bull in china shop with no government experience overturn everything in the china shop - which is about how a four year-old throwing a temper tantrum behaves when it doesn't get its way. Except in this case the china shop is all of us.

"""No one organization can address all of society's evils and shortcomings.""  

True.  But when blacks are murdered far more often by black civilians than by police, AND the organization that calls itself ""Black Lives Matter"" is virtually silent on the subject of black-on-black murder, I have to doubt the genuineness of the organization.  Reason would tell you that you'd hear BLM address this issue far more vocally and far more often --- if their main concern really were that black lives are being lost to murder."

In those cases, the employer will still be in the right if he can establish a bona fide occupational requirement for the decision.

Look at the muslim girl this week that will probably be put to jail because of her cloths, yes, her cloths. Any group that would do that is somewhat disgusting."
"Would not an ultimate racist be a disturbed half-white man who longs to be black because his absent father was black, and dislikes a majority white country."
Because black on black deaths didn't mean $hit...but come hell or high water we stand up against the media hyped race war and will protest.  Wake the flock up sheeple.
Black people need to act more like white people .
"Ha-ha-ha! So glad Spur is paying for their racist bias against whites. FANTASTIC! I am not a member of Front Nasionaal. Most Afrikaners don't even know of its existence. So no, it is NOT Front Nasionaal's ""right wing"" boycott that's to blame. Spur caused the boycott by ignoring facts and taking a racist position against a white man. Firstly, the black woman's older son beat up on the white man's much smaller daughter. When she was asked to discipline her child by a concerned father, she started swearing at him like street walker and refused. He got angry at her and pretended that he was going to attack her. He never actually attacked her - he threatened by making certain gestures in order to intimidate. And Spur goes completely crazy, taking her side - the mother of a disgusting little bully who should have been given a hiding. Because she's black! Spur will never see me again. If they are so pro black people without any manners, let those support their business!!! Idiots!"
"Blacks make up approximately 13% of the US population while they commit 52% of crime. In 2014 according to the FBI, 90% of black homicide victims were killed by other black people.

Honestly, this is where the protesting should be."
"ROFL!

Great point!
The Irony!
Leftists (aka Democrats) get all stupid fomented if you try keeping a certain, shall we say, ""demographic"" in any kind of plantation mentality. They go ballistic! But then in Hawaii, it is okay. This pidgin is all plantation history and culture, you know, and needs to be nurtured and continued.
Waht?! y'all don't want the blacks in a plantation mindset but you want to keep the browns in a plantation mindset??!!!

Explain away THAT contradiction, i challenge any Democrat to do."
"Mainstream liberal media were all stunned by Trump's victory in spite of their unceasing and relentless demonizing of Trump as being a racist, a bigot, etc. etc.

It appears that mainstream liberal journalists can not accept a presidency of Donald Trump ergo this so-called ""racism"", one of the very thing to demonize Trump during the election campaign.

But on the question - Why did people vote for Trump

Simple:  
(1) Build the wall  
(2) Renegotiate trade agreements 
(3) Drain the Swamp.

Racism?  

How can one even think of racism when Trump intends to tackle low income African-Americans and Latinos in inner cities in his ""Make America Again"" programs."
"So much better to just ignore cops killing blacks, right fiveo?  They deserve it.  We just want to watch a football game and get drunk.  So very American.   

If God did have a hand in the founding, he or she must be shaking their head like crazy today.  

How could a country get away from God so much where violance is tolerated and actually celebrated each week?  So very Christian."
John Lewis!!!  You ARE a RACIST IDIOT!!!  YOU have NO decency whatsoever because you only support your own race.  You do not care about the white race because YOU ARE RACIST!!!  YOU DO NOT belong in public service because not everyone is BLACK!!!
Actually aparthied was created to protect whites from violent blacks. Now that whites have no power all of their fears are playing out and genocide is in full swing. The white population has gone from 30% to less than 10%.
"How dare a black man express an opinion, right?"
Black people are not voting for the candidate endorsed by the KKK and neo-Nazis. That is a white thing.

Many black voters simply didn't vote for the privileged old white lady who ran for the Democrats.  This column is a racist as  any alt white racist attack on Obama. All it does is dumb down the matter.
"Yeah, Democrats like slavery. And yet black people vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. Silly black people."
"There are many black police chiefs that are just as bad as the many white police chiefs.  The problem
Is that to those blacks, only black lives matter.  They don't care about anyone else but blacks...and I call that being racist.  So, black lives matter is a waha corrupt organization of no value to anyone but blacks."
"Don the magic negro is an embarrassment to his own race, civilized society, Canada, Ottawa, and his shamed family."
You forgot to add that black people are WAY more likely to comit violentlent crimes than whites thus they have much higher interaction rates with police.  So if you look at it that way a (Harvard study did this year) if anything whites were shot at a higher rate than blacks.
"Kim80, it's fun to make fun of black people, what with their ""history"" of slavery and poverty. The police have a tough gig keeping the ""coloreds"" in line, don't they?"
"You clearly missed the entire point.  Kneeling during a mere song is offensive? But, killing black people a simple traffic stops is justifiable?  You are as sick as tRump the buffoon."
Black people ruin everything.
"Stupid people use the silly term ""African American"" in a desperate attempt to be politically-correct.

They don't realize that Africa is a continent - not a country.

Omar Sharif is from Egypt but lived here. Dave Matthews and Charlize Theron moved here from South Africa. I guess that makes them all African Americans!

What do you call a black guy in Canada? An African Canadian? An African North American?

Some folks just can't think for themselves."
"Well, now, up until the last sentence I was willing to consider your point of view.  But you had to inject a racist comment, and that invalidated your entire post as far as I'm concerned. Yes, people who denigrate whites are just as racist as those who commit racial slurs against blacks or Latinos or other people of color.  It is apparent that you don't like whites in Langley (""that is a shame"").  So, Mstraub, to you I say:  suck it up, cupcake and soldier on, we're here to stay."
"Steve35, you are obviously a racist.  Vast majority of black people don't commit crimes.  You truly have no understanding of history and why blacks are disenfranchised in this country.  Keep living in your bubble.  You will always be wrong"
"To all NFL players: Racist (or oppressive) cops are not the problem for blacks in America!

Racist cops are not the reason blacks commit over one half of all murders in this country.

Racist cops are not the reason blacks commit over 60% of robberies and almost one half of all assaults in this country.

Racist cops are not the cause of the breakdown of the black family with 75% of black babies being born out of wedlock resulting in many fatherless families.

Racist cops are not the reason that 75% of the murders in New York City are committed by blacks (and the NYC police department is a majority/minority police force).

This is the elephant in the room that nobody has been talking about. Colin Kaepernick started these protests last year predicated on his (and many in the NFL) belief that the police target blacks because they are racists. Yes, there probably are some racist cops, but this is not the problem for blacks in poor black communities. Black on black crime is the problem."

What a ridiculous opinion article. Why is she such a racist and assume that 'black America' is a monolithic block that votes and thinks the same way? How about the 10% of 'blacks' who voted for Trump? Why does she think some politicians like Lewis or Obama are beyond scrutiny and can't be criticized?

This is why we cannot have nice things, I guess. Too many of the ignorant and the stupid and those with broken moral compasses who still get out and vote...not to mention the conservative machine that emits propaganda on the daily, as well as helps to rig elections.

"Sylvia - I get your passion. Black and Brown men are probably very scary to you. But ""unarmed"" means there really should be no reason to use lethal force. Cops are trained to use a plethora of techniques that are non-lethal - it's just clear that more and more cops are surpassing their training and jumping to lethal force more quickly and, in many cases, unnecessarily - especially against black men and boys. 

""Protecting"" a community by labeling it ""criminal"" and brutalizing it is similar to the logic used by every dictatorship in history - speaking of ignorance. And not sure what evidence you have or logic you're using for your ""...letting out white predators earlier so they can go back to predatorializing on white communities..."" rant."

It's no coincidence that the core of Trump's support was white males."
Hey now.....Black frats have had just as many incidents with their equally stupid rituals.
"Too little, too late. The Broncos can go p!ss up a rope. These millionaire cry babies are nothing but overpaid, stupid, selfish, and entitled turds. They're too busy thugging around and doing nothing to promote a healthy community. If the cared about 'black lives' they would tell their fan base to go to school, get jobs, and follow the law."
"It's insulting speech, it's hatred, it's discrimination, it promotes violence and it has no place in a civilized society. Would you defend a bunch of racists yelling the N* word at blacks passing by? Or C* word to women passing by? There is a fine line that one is to not cross in public and if anyone like the Democrat heavy ACLU wants to defend these scum then they are promoting racism, hatred and violence! Where's the public apology from the ACLU for defending the KKK?"
"Poor little sicko ""Allaha"" still thinks it's OK to discriminate against gay people. I guess he doesn't like Jews and African-Americans too.  Or do you just discriminate against the gay people you sicko. Frankly, I disapprove of you and your neanderthal brain."
Typical and expected hate from the completely intolerant left.  The black church that was vandalized down in Dixie with Trump spray painted on the side was done by a black man.  The left represents the most hateful intolerant violent sector of society yet they still whine about losing the presidency and both houses of congress.
Some 800 black people are shot and killed every year in Chicago  but we are forbidden to speak of it.  A white guy is accused of murder and you write us a tome.
"The idiocy is yours in the way you portray Obama.   Hard to believe you don't ever consider your own reflection in the mirror.   Your bigotry to tag all black people because of rap lyrics is nothing but racist crap.    You'll find most of that same language in punk and rock and roll.   Was Elvis your choir boy, the young one or the drug addled junkie talking to Richard Nixon?  PRESIDENT  Obama has received more death threats than any president in history.   He's divisive to you only because he's black.   

When is comes to reconciliation it requires a lot of humility, a lot of active listening, a lot of forgiveness.     How would you even begin to recognize that with your built in anger?   Why don't you talk about the racist remarks thrown toward the President before he was ever elected?   I was in Iowa at the first primary and while Iowan's are mostly generous people, there was no lack of representation of bigots as well."
"HabFan410 - both sides can say they oppose racism but Trump has a long history of it.  Refusing to rent to blacks, outright racist statements against them, Mexicans and others, a campaign to delegitimize Obama as not born in America, stoking outrage against black youth accused (and acquitted) of rape - Trump is one ugly hombre on this matter and those cheering him on, I suspect, share many of his shortcomings."

"Give me a break..........Trump the protector of racists.

Did you not hear and ready what he said on the day of the tragic event and his subsequent comments.

Where was your editorial criticizing Obama and the other democratic leaders who applauded and hosts racists groups like Black Lives Matter and the ultra far left who won't tolerate free speech on campuses if the views don't support their own narrow approach.  No comment because you hypocrites!!

Get a grip on life.   No one supports racists from the left or the right.

Condemn them both."
"Blacks are blacks worst enemy, there's still no remedy, got me for a grip and you call yourself kin of me.  Jealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes, tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise."
The comments on that page are so ridiculously racial and bias that even ASD school administrators showed their horrible real selves.

"Yes, the alt-right racists Trump caters to as well as Bannon, a proud racist, are fully responsible. 

Sorry, you don't believe that black lives matter as much as your life, which is the purpose of the movement against wanton violence against blacks.

"How am I deflecting from Trump? You specifically said earlier,
""Actually, no, they don't. I don't recall any incitements to violence at Democratic campaign rallies.""
So I brought up how Hillary For America, a Hillary Super PAC, was caught funding mentally challenged and homeless people to instigate violence from Trump supporters by standing near them, insulting their family and children, etc. until they got a physical reaction (imagine going to a black neighborhood and shouting racist things, you would get your ass kicked) or actually paying rioters to start chaos at Trump rallies such as in Chicago.

"Oh really? I've had death threats leveled at me on other platforms by the right wing. Oh, and constant ""jokes"" about shoving people in ovens from the same.

In the past, I used to use my real name on various media platforms, until I started getting cons posting my real home address and remarks about visiting my family. I've had butthurt cons look up where I work, call there, and try to get me fired. And all because they were schooled by someone smarter than them.


Unfortunately, those behaviors were BEFORE that idiot was installed in the WH by the EC, now making these awful deplorables think they are now (even more) entitled to such behaviors.

These immigrant rape thing is one of the most racist things I have seen since ""black men are gonna bed your white daughters.""

Monica agreed to have sex with Bill. Trump talks about sexual assault without consent. The two are not even in the same ballpark.

In case you missed it, Trump called for the execution of men that were found innocent. You should look up the Central Park 5. Pure Racism.

2. Why does TODAY'S Democratic Party get most of the black vote?"
Trump cannot stand the black guy bettering him. Obama should put out a statement daily until Trump has a stroke.

"Whoever holds more power will ultimately have the upper hand. It works the same way in non-White societies. North Koreans are racist against non-North Koreans. Black Africans are racist against other Black Africans. Japanese are racist against Koreans and vice versa.

So you think it's okay to have black slaves and relegate them to the back of the bus and separate facilities and that it's okay for cops to profile and kill innocent blacks.
"It’s silly to dismiss criticism of President Trump for the times he’s a jerk or wrong unless that critic did the same for President Obama for the times he was a jerk or wrong.

Just as silly was the notion that any criticism of Obama was rooted in or the result of racism. To frame it that way, one could never be critical of or disagree with a black politician. Which was probably the goal."

"If the ears that don't listen are black, it's a capital crime."
"It is time. America.

It is time for racist America to accept responsibility and be held accountable for creating a despicable racist monster as Donald Trump. The key to Trump’s rise to power is America’s pride of its slave days and the wanton killing of Native Americans of the American West.

What we see and experience today is part of that legacy. 

There is no other explanation. That legacy is here in Anchorage with the wanton killings of Native people  on our streets, run down like animals and left to die. It is in our cities by rogue hate cops killing black and brown people at will. 

Donald Trump, with all of his hate and bigotry, from his “hate Obama is not an American birther” days to his kick all 11-million Hispanics out, is your creation. I can only conclude that might include some of my Hispanic family.

And the white media? They all smile and laugh about Trump like high-school kids watching a school-yard bully."

UCT was once rated by the world as in the top 100 of all Western universities. No longer. No argument that when societies beliefs change, here on race, societies institutions are invariably also going to need to change to reflect new realities. Sure, here let students protest, make a noise ......... but not through burning, destruction, trampling the rights of others, breaking and looting, piles of shit on the floor. Please, promote a reasoned argument and deliver it with intellectual force.

That is not happening here. This arrogant, naive, destructive, backward, savage ill - informed performance,  is not acceptable in civilised societies.

"I'm not sure what you are talking about but my point is, any black man getting self-righteous about violence committed by any group of people in the United States is ridiculous. Black people shouldn't act like saints above reproach, according to the ten commandments they are as flawed as the rest of mankind. A little truth would go a long ways for them but they prefer a fantasy narrative that exists in another world."

"Pitt's doesn't get it . Others have been fired for making even lesser public comments like this . This lady didn't get fired clearly because she's black . ESPN got rid of one guy simply because his name was Robert Lee. The kicker was the guy was oriental .  When you work in a public forum , you are held to a higher standard . You KNOW that when you sign up . Not only was this lady ignorant and stupid for what she said about Trump---she doubled down on her stupidity by making her comments in a public forum. ESPN was clearly wrong for not firing her---or at the very least suspending her .  Just as the last lady , in public office of all places , should have been fired for publicly calling for Trump to be killed . Both got off because they were black .  White women would have been fired in both these cases and the national press would have celebrated it as justice. Talk about a double standard ."
"Sorry, I meant white ethnic Catholics (WI, PA, MI).  We supplied the votes.

As many of you may know, CatholicsForTrump -- led by Frank Bertoni, Esq. -- helped register nearly 500,000 white Catholics in 5 key battleground states.  Turnout was increased by 10% over 2012 levels.  

Besides moral and cultural issues, CFT focused on (1) ending welfare queens ability to steal money from suburban taxpayers (2)  ending racial quotas and affirmative action reverse discrimination programs (3) locking up criminals and accelerating the death penalty (4) attacking Black Lies Matter as a racist, Jew-hating, anti-Catholic ghetto criminal organization.

The Left and the media never saw it coming.   Of course not.  

Wait till you see what we have planned for 2018 and 2020.  The Left is going to rue the day they bussed Irish Catholics.....closed down Italian-American owned businesses.....discriminated against white ethnic Catholics....attacked religious liberty...and stole Church property for the ACLU"
"What's the matter?   Do you not know real history?  Probably not if you're a white American.  You've established your identity on a fairy tale.  Making the conversation about me instead of reality is what people do when they can't discuss anything measurable.   It's not intelligent. The exploitation of themselves that white people voted against by voting for Trump is of their own creation.  They just didn't care when it was Native people and black people being slaughtered and brutalized by the millions.  They could continue with how great and ""free"" America is, along with their meritocracy-equality fantasy drivel.   The truth is that the poor were exploited and crushed in this country for centuries until FDR came up with the New Deal.  It didn't extend to anyone but whites, however.  Since the idiots started voting for actors, those policies have been under attack, but they couldn't see it.  Oh, wah."

"LOL.  Is that the best you have?   So it is okay if minorities insult each other and whites?  It is okay for blacks to own blacks?   It is okay for blacks to shoot blacks and whites?  All because of the so called white privilege?

Are you trying to stir shit up in our community?  What was your point?  You do know that the black lives matter movement was classified as a terrorist organization after the shit that went down in Dallas?"

Shame on you."
"10 times more black people kill other black people then white cops kill black people. yet, Colin Kapernick did not protest that  once regarding that. Not once. And no other NFL star did either. I guess he thinks it's ok if Black people die as long as it depends on who is doing the killing. 
doesn't that sound a little like a hypercrite. I also looked up because you wouldn't get this from the media. More white people get killed from police then black people. I was stunned when I looked that up. Yes, as a percentage the numbers change but from the media you would think that only black people get killed by cops. The FBI stat I saw was 2100. white people killed and 1150 black people. Over a 5 year time frame. Again, blacks make up less of the population , I get that , but its not like it's 3 white people and 6,000. black people killed by cops."

This is found documented in her article, ""Young Facists COLONIZE PORTLAND""

She also uses her lack of class to say that there is still violence and ""It’s home-grown, native-on-native.""

That's a very long winded way to say 'them uppity blacks mess everything up'. Which is all you really said. I don't converse with racists and you are among the worst racists I have encountered in a long time. So please feel free to go forth and fornicate with yourself as I will never reply to you again.

My point is, History is not always pretty... this foolishness will not end until the left succeeds in destroying everything that defines America...That is their goal, to undermine and destroy... Then to remake in their Socialist Utopian image.... an ideal that doesn't work...
Do You want that?"

"It is astounding that she didn't stop herself when she looked in the mirror at herself doing black-face. I wonder how much American history is required to obtain a degree in law. Apparently, not enough. We've seen (and lamented) how Trump's racist cartoonishness has had an effect on less educated white people but I guess this would be an example of how it affects educated upper-middle class whites. She didn't intend to denigrate anyone, rather the opposite, but this incident demonstrates how many white people just don't have a clue, even after they read a book detailing racism. 
It was arrogance on her part to think that just because she read a book detailing racism and was fired up about it that that somehow gave her permission to reproduce and re-enact the black-face tradition that mocks and derides African-Americans.
How could she think no one would take a photograph of her? How could she not consider this possibility? She was astoundingly stupid."
"I agree that Hillary has worked hard. Can you name any of her accomplishments as Sec. of State? Can you name any legislation she initiated that helped women and children? She supported NAFTA, putting people in jail for minor crimes, wanted to make black super predators heel, and her support for the defense of marriage act which banned gay marriages. She has called women trailer trash and bimbos that just happened to been involved with her husband. She is a stellar example of progressive policy. Write in Bernie Sanders, please!!"

What a joke. Democrats and Hillary made a statement about sexual predators when they voted in favor of Billy being elected even though the knowledge of the mans sexual deviance was laid out to the entire country. Democrats make a statement in favor of gross sexual perversion when they support and defend gays and lesbians. They make a statement about sexual perversion when they agree that a sexually deviant woman should be allowed to kill her own baby. They made a statement to the entire world when a transgender spoke at the democratic convention setting the example for all of our children that law and order does not matter and your feelings trump anything. Pot calling the kettle black for sure. The manipulation and hypocrisy coming from the democrats is mind boggling to say the least. But we must understand they are drinking a kool aid that distorts the mind. Its called free lovism and situational ethics. Hail Hillary!!!!

You don't really think I am dumb you are just pissed because my truths about the 70% of black children born to single mothers and the black community represent over 50% of the murders committed in this country.

I guess those shooting aren't as important as the issue they are protesting about.

"So blacks and gays are now targeting the police. Perfect. As if that is going to change any respect those groups have for one another. It's only going to rule out the support and assistance the police have given to these groups. 
Next time a black or gay person needs police support, good luck with that. The police should just ignore both communities and let them fend for themselves. Black crime in the northwest and northeast of Toronto should just be allowed to fester. The police now have a license to only deal with and address when these groups commit criminal acts against other communities. Hopefully this will reduce the high cost of police presence in the black communities. Let them rot."

Just how much discrimination in college admissions, violent crime against whites by blacks, and being beaten over the head with the notion that ""whiteness is a great evil"" are whites supposed to take?  There are professors that are calling for white genocide and uttering anti-white sentiments.  

White liberals can certainly be called out for their hypocrisy in supporting minorities yet refusing to live among them or send their kids to diverse schools.  The reality is that they refuse to admit why they don't do that - it's because too many low performing minorities drag down a school and whites simply don't want their children bullied or beaten up."

It's racist if you live someplace where the thugs are all black. But in Anchorage thugs come in all colors.
"I do not deal with blacks if I can avoid them; at a check out counter I will always wait or go out of my way to go to a White person or an East Indian or an Oriental. On a professional basis it is get me the Jew or a White or a Oriental or an East Indian...never ever would I deal with a black and IQ is the whole story, and the rest is world wide common sense."
"People with kids get's retrenched''' oh wow,,and what about the white man's kid that got slapped in the face and no body bats an eye?? Only the black women that also act in a rassis manner got a free f@$# lunch??? AND THE WHITE MAN GOT BANNED!!!!!!!!! Go F$$@ yourself Spur!! NEVER IN MY LIVE AGAIN"
"There was a time when the Democrats appealed to the racists by opposing integration, today these Democrats appeal to the racists by killing black/brown babies, truly disgusting."
"""Hopefully this museum makes us talk to each other,"" he said. ""And more importantly listen to each other. And most importantly see each other.""

What will it do to prevent blacks killing blacks?"
As long as they are white. You'd never do that to a black actor.
"Over paid entertainers, making millions a year, with IQ's just above a moron and they are complaining.  Kneeling to show support for organizations that promote killing police officers, and claiming that Blacks are being targeted by the Police, are pathetic.  More whites are killed by police, more blacks kill blacks than whites, where is the beef."
She is a black supremacist!!!
Taking a knee in silence is not shoving anything down your throats.  You sound like black people live in a f**king utopia and should never complain when massah gives them a beating or a killing.   Will you blame them when they start killing white people?  Why?
"Keep up the good work fast food frequent flyers. It's one way to end homeless , hippies and niggers! Way to go McDonalds!"
"You are the black 'living in fear in Oregon' it would appear.

Sad, Pathetic, Eeyore."
"This fool says his suspension is racially motivated because the accuser is a white woman.  When a woman is beaten black n blue, I don't really think her race comes into it."
"If this was true, Hillary would be president today instead of the clown.

In addition Black lives matters are not idiots.  White supremacists are just plain idiot racists who never got over Obama winning.  Bunch of losers who have never figured out how to enter the 21st century."
"It's funny that when a black person commits an outlandish crime, all black people are implicated by association.  But when a white person commits an outlandish crime, it's just that person and they don't represent all white people. I'm almost 60, raised good, responsible children, contributed to society as a hard worker in several successful careers, and have never been arrested for anything (not even a speeding ticket). Yet, I'm lumped together with these two hoods who robbed a bank simply because they're black and I'm black!"
"Left lunacy.  This professor wants me to be upset that white men made mathematical discoveries. This is, by far, the dumbest argument I have ever heard.  BTW:  I  am woman of color who loves math."
Wow...they said nigger and the libs went crazy....lol...too funny.
"The racist Liberal Media has concluded that this was a racist incident!, white cops shot and killed a black woman. Yikes!  Where's Barry, Jesse, Al, Fredericka, etc. on this? they'd be like flies on White Rice in situation like these. It's a White on Black crime
Did the ""facts"" come out yet or are the White Haters jumping to conclusions like all Democrats do? One Day you White Haters, Racists and Liberal Democrats will get it Right, ya know 
Where's the BLM's,  ""pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon,"" chants? They all started a bon fiya yet? Any burning vehicles in the streets? Has the Looting started yet?"
"Religious Hypocrites from Alabama....sick evil people. The past should be your guide folks, these people used the Bible to legitimize slavery, they used the Bible to legitimize segregation, they used the Bible to keep it illegal for blacks to marry whites....is there no limit to their warped view of morality? No there is not, they will even go as far as using the Bible to defend a PEDOPHILE. Politicians in Alabama have been doing it for over a hundred years, they know if they can wrap some bulls*it in a quilt of so-called-Christian dogma that the poor ignorant redneck populace will swallow it whole and ask for seconds. The decent people in Alabama don't even vote anymore because they know how corrupt and broken their government has been for so long. Funny how these people raise their young sons to be respectful of the fairer sex, opening doors for women, saying yes & no ma'am, treating every lady like a queen. So Alabama, is it ok for a lawyer to molest a 14 year old little girl?"
"How come our elected representatives strive to make us look like idiots in the nation's eyes. Mr. Schatz, please sit down and be quiet, you have embarrassed yourself and your constituents long enough. 

Mrs. Hanabusa, disgraceful are the White supremacists, as well as the hate of the GLBTIQ, Black Panthers, Black Lives Matter, Neo-Nazis, and the militant Hawaiian community here. Where is your disgust for them and your call to stop the racist hate speech??? No, those are your financial contributors right? Hypocrite!"
"Not really.

People are killing each other in order to obtain or preserve power over the masses and to shape society and harness resources as they see fit.

Hitler did it. Mao did it. Stalin did it. Lincoln did it. Pol Pot did it. So did Ivan the Terrible. The native tribes of North America did it. The British did it all over the world. 

The ""trample on other"" instinct is very powerful in humans and transcends religious beliefs. That is how you have Christian whites in the southern USA slaughtering Christian blacks in the southern USA, and how you have castes in India of the same religion trampling upon one another, that is how you had the north and south in the American civil war having the same religion.

People kill each other in order to obtain or preserve power over the masses and to shape society and harness resources as they see fit. That ""trample on other"" instinct is actually the core and key problem, not the matter of whether others worship trees or have darker skin."
"Your actually not worth my time. I'm married to a Mexican american. Sooo what the hell does that mean. You still are a closet racist and can't admit there is room for improvement in the US. I don't care who you're married to, you still have a problem if you can't admit that calling a black person a monkey probably hurts worse than showing a meme of GW as a monkey.
 The other thing is how do you know anyone was raped back in the 1800's. Dude you might be straight forward, but as of now I call B/S.
 You start out married to a woman of color. But then you turn into a man of color. You are a f'n troll. We are done. You're about as black as my Irish  family. What a loser you are. Oh by the way put down the bottle so you will be able to read, I'm not remorse.
 Yes I'll tell you about racism and utopias because you seem ignorant to it all. Go back to mama's basement and leave folks with a brain alone"
"So the party of slavery, Jim Crow, the KKK, and filibusters blocking civil rights legislation has unmasked an affinity for white supremacy in the party of Lincoln and the Civil Rights Acts (beginning with Eisenhower and culminating with Dirksen)!  

How could I have missed it?  Tiki-torch bearing ""crisis actors' enlisted by a former Occupy Wall Street organizer clashed with black-hooded balaclava-masked thugs hired by George Soros, and I thought I was seeing a revival of '60's street theater.

That is, until Donald Trump condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.""   Silly me, I thought there was only one side protesting."
"I swear, fools really believe that cops put on their gear in the morning and say ""I sure hope I get my life ruined while shooting a black guy today""!!!!!"
"Apparently  the emails state he buys meth from gay Islamic party boys, who are transphobic, hate blacks, puppies, and illegally voted for Hillary !!!"
"CK needs to wake up to the fact that if some people don't like him, it might NOT be because he's part  black. It just might be simply that he is a jerk. This whole thing is no more than what the left calls ""raising awareness"" of something that they want to complain about: white cops murdering poor, innocent black people. Well, guess what? We've heard it all before in the cases of Trayvon Martin, who was just trying a bash somebody's skull in, and ""Gentle Giant"" Mikey, who was trying to surrender with his hands up, pleading for the cop not to shoot. In both cases, black witnesses flat out lied about what they saw and heard. Were the liars ever prosecuted for filing a false report or for perjury in court? Nope.

Kaepernick can take his ""protest"" and ""raise the awareness"" of somebody who believes all that black BS and gives a damn. I am tired of listening to black people bellyaching that they have to obey the law and comply with the orders of LEOs who are doing their job."
"Civil rights act? Are you nuts.  Nothing civil about liberal black welfare planation's in all our major cities.  Progressives are the real slavers!  The young communist league from Harvard went down to stir up trouble.  Southern Blacks were not the ones complaining, it was WHITE libs...same as now!!!"
"Your coyness doesn't  work with anyone, as everyone knows that your ""Drunks' Lives Matter"" and ""Don't Shoot"" is mocking blacks and their Black Lives Matter and ""Don't Shoot."" Not everyone is as stupid as you."
"You constantly imply that everyone who is white is always against the blacks and therefore are all racists.   

Including trying to connect me personally to David Duke in this thread.  

I was very careful not to call you a black racist despite that.

I need nothing from you."
"Poor Hillary, a bitter, crooked woman who cannot get over her loss. This is a woman who has no accomplishments and who used the fawning liberal media to build her up and erase her corrupt activities. But the American people saw thru all of it, and rejected her. Liberals, especially Hillary divide people along racial, religious and regional lines among others. Then she was beaten by the black guy (obama) and realized that blacks coalesced around Blacks because they are the most racist ethic group.  But women do not all adhere to gender politics. Blacks and gays are higher up on the liberal  totem pole than women. Hillary, the most unoriginal politician in the public eye, uses only focus-group tested cliches. There is no core, to this woman. She is as corrupt as they come."
"This is a sarcastic joke, right? Pointing out the ridiculous statements being made justifying cops killing blacks."
"Then you whiny idiots say, it's the black man's fault, it's the immigrants fault lol!! It's everyone else's fault but your OWN!?? That's called weakness, that's pathetic!!"
"Quotes from Black Lives Matter's Yusra Khogali who just got $250,000
‘Allah give me strength not to cuss/kill these men and white folks.’
“Whiteness is not humaness,” “infact, white skin is sub-human.”
“White ppl are recessive genetic defects. this is factual, white ppl need white supremacy as a mechanism to protect their survival as a people because all they can do is produce themselves. black ppl simply through their dominant genes can literally wipe out the white race if we had the power to.
“What wypipo don’t understand is that this is not like our elder’s movement. We will snatch your edges and clap you back into ashes. We will also beat that *** Becky. Run up.”
“[A]ll phenotypes exist within the black family and white ppl are a genetic defect of blackness.”
""white people are inferior to blacks because they “have a higher concentration of enzyme inhibitors that suppress melanin production.”
Gee thanks."
"And why would YOU ever think that ....  hmmm...?  

Oh that's right ... Mr. Obama is still black!

Trump is an imbecile."
You know diddly about the Affordable Care Act or the nation's healthcare issues.  You just see black skin and automatically your racist pea brain snaps shut.

"Call me crazy, but I'm going to say ""new negroes"" if people ask me what that New Negroes show is titled."

"Well, *someone* seems awfully upset that this stupid thing didn't pass. When are you guys going to figure out that ACA is not the terrible thing you think it is just because it is associated with the black President? 


It seems like a majority of Americans have finally figured it out, in spite of the massive amounts of lying the right wing does about it.


I guess the con base is always the last to figure it out, if they ever do."
"Oh, and ""mass murders?"" In the past 50 years, about 900 people have died in such incidents in America, and not all of the peeps were white. In one Democrat- run American city alone - Chicago - that many people are murdered by blacks every 18 MONTHS. Wonder what the numbers are in Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis, Newark, etc. 

You're getting your ass kicked here, need I go on?"
"Totally agree...he can't accept any blame whatsoever....let's just blame the black guy....as of today:  his OWN REPUBLICAN leaks from the White House are Obama's fault (are you kidding me?) and the botched raid in which a SEAL died last month is the military's (and Obama's, by the way !!!) fault!!"
"Yeah Mike quick your right Obama never had any scadals,at least none that the media would cover, comment on or bring to the attention of douchebags such as your self.so if you don't count solndra,fast and furious,the black panther voter suppression,failed stimulus,lying about hands up don't shoot and Trevon Martin, Benghazi slaughter that they sat and watched happening and never lifted a finger to send help and then lied to the families and all of us about some stupid vedio,the list goes on and on. But yeah I'm the idiot Mike.im the idiot because I still expect that kind of crap to matter to people like you,brainless sheep."
"You don't have a clue, Jinx, and you don't have a point, unless you think that stating the obvious is making a point. Whites shoot each other on a daily basis. What else is new? You can call me a honkey, and I don't care; but what your racism won't allow you to see is that it does matter (it's different) when a white guy uses the N-word or words to that affect against blacks."
"As in ""take a whiz?"" Little d's tirade....think about how many things came to mind...about Rep. Lewis is so sad, stupid, lame, ignorant. He does have a clue who Lewis is? We are faced with a level of stupid that I thought was going to be impossible to ever reach. He says that Lewis needs to focus on his district, lot's of crime, because he's a black man and of course all blacks live in hell...this racist! This is really stupid!
Little d's defenders have stepped up say what he says doesn't matter, they forgive his stupidity because he's tapped a vein, a vein of hatred, and vein filled with vitriol. And awash in it, they profess he's not really saying what he thinks when he tweets...based on lies...and so we head down the next rung down on the stupid ladder. How low can we go?"
"Unfortunately, this country was founded as a white racist nation. Most white folks don't want to admit this simple fact.  The proof is in the Constitution. The 2nd Amendment is all about white privilege. To this day, white men can show up at political rallies armed with AR-15's. Black people are shot on sight for the suspicion of being armed."

"Trump simply can not go a day without lying. He has corrupted and debased the Presidency and American culture to the point it may never recover.
Instead of the howling from conservative Caucasian preachers about a black President being the 'Anti-Christ,' Donald Trump has become the most evil, divisive, selfish, corrupt, untrustworthy Machiavellian figures in modern history.

These preachers and their so-called 'religion' never got past the color of the President's skin. Ignorance and ineptitude are natural consequences of bigotry combined with fear."

"Those pigs that tortured that guy had no justification for doing so. Even our most ardent black racists in this forum will not defend them, yet I am sure that white racists will use this as a talking point.

Any punishment of Trump would of course have to follow a trial, during which we would of course have to be presented with proof. Yet I do certainly believe that conspiring with a foreign head of state to influence a US election ought to be a capital offense."
"Oh please! Explain Donald Trump then. He's a racist, misogynist, bigoted jerk who speaks for other racist, misogynist, bigoted jerks. And he's leading in the Republican party.

The president did not disrespect this woman and you know it and everyone else knows it. You, the rat-in-the-hat, the greazy black sisters and the widow herself are all Trump haters. Now you don't have to be a Rhodes Scholar to figure that out. And if you think you know better than you tell me that President Trump would waste his time to call this woman to pay his condolences to simply disrespect her or insult her in some kind of way. And if you believe that BS to be true than you, the rat-in-the-hat, the greazy black sisters, and the widow herself should all run off together and go somewhere...anywhere just get gone ...

These people are dirty lying rotten scoundrels who operate like this 24/7

It's funny how character, morals, the things a person says, the views a person has seemed to matter so much just a short time ago!

 “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes… Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else…Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that’s guy’s lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks,”

Misogyny is a made-up liberal word.  Basically, if you don't support abortion, the ERA, and NOW, you're a misogynist.  Got it.

Fascism was supported by liberals when Uncle Joe Stalin thought it convenient."

"Oh and your not bringing race into this with your article?  Why don't you mention all of the ""white"" people that get shot by cops?  Reason it's a black issue, is that the blacks scream louder, riot, and the media cant help themselves by perpetuating the story to bring in ratings.  Why don't you become a cop and see how much ""fun"" it is to go out and put your life at risk everyday not knowing what your going to encounter, or what some crazy idiot is going to try and do you today?"
Must be the black caucus doing this because there so stupid they still believe that the progressive socialist liberal demorats propaganda

"the other night I was out for dinner with my wife and friends, unfortunately my best friend brought his rich ignorant brother-in-law and sister with us . His brother-in-law made some ignorant comment about black people and my wife hammered him calling him a ignorant racist, and that he should keep his mouth shut. I have never been so impressed by my wife! We need more people to be so brave. I hate racists! Sadly they make their comments and seem to think that others agree with them. How pathetic."
That's all well and good but when it's all the blacks in the sports taking the knee and raising  their closed fist...remember the Black Power salute?...then it's them who are creating and dividing our country....it'll all end when they stop doing this crap...
You equate the Left with being black... what is wrong with your brain?
and this is why the socialist left never said a word when ISIS AND THE TALIBAN desecrate Buddhist statues and temples and blow up christian churches.....We need to rid ourselves of the scourge of liberal socialism immediately. I DEMAND THE ARREST OF THE SOCIALIST BLACK BIGOT SENATOR XBXTXCH FROM MISSOURI WHO IS CALLING FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF OUR PRESIDENT.....PUT HER IN JAIL NOW......AND SHUT DOWN THE ISLAMIC TERRORIST SYMPATHIZERS IN THE MEDIA.
"So the side that has repeatedly been racist as hell is now trying to play the race card for black people?

Are you kidding me? Are you even serious? 

Just so you know ""It is too much power to avoid eventual oppression of the masses"" this is paranoia.
It is a mental illness. You are mentally ill if you think the government is coming for your guns and you can do anything about it, so just give them up, you already failed the mental welfare check."
Did the black slaves have guns in your made up world?
"""Nazi boneheads deserve being punched.""
===========
No one ""deserves"" to be punched. Assault and battery is a crime. Simply being a Nazi is not. Those who resort to violence or who think that violence is justified simply by what another person believes or says.....is worse than the Nazi.
-
Anyone who punches a Nazi simply because he is a Nazi is no better than someone who punches a black person simply because he is black, or who punches a gay person simply because he is gay."
"I wonder what the fat, old, white guys would say if all the positions on the Supreme Court were currently filled by black women?"
Imagine if it had been black people instead white rednecks.
"It's our police killing blacks!  Why......why.......it has to be, doesn't it?"
Blacks oppress themselves!
This is about what you would expect: A black guy advocating his own lynching by supporting RW Nazis. Does any rational person even believe this crap anymore?
"Actually they refused to make a conjecture about the electoral impact. If Clinton had made Booker VP, the Obama-only black voters would have come out and we would not have an idiot president."
"What a pinhead Trump is. Instead of being concerned about the anthem or the flag why isn't he concerned that African American people are still going through horrendous treatment 60 years after Little Rock and other segregation era policies. 50 years after the Black power salute at the 1968 Olympics and these people still have to go through this.

That's what the concern should be, not about the stupid anthem or flag. How ignorant does your president have to get before you clueless folks who back him  tell him he's a fool and a complete embarrassment to the USA."
"Just another black man raping white women. 

Should we ban a flag or topple a statue?"
If you have ever popped a pill or taken any kind of drugs then you Neal Black are just another drug user. Same philosophy. I noticed that your name is Neil Black but your photo is a white guy. Using your same brainless philosophy does this now make you Black?
"You clearly did not read the story as the woman voluntarily left her job, it was not because she 'fell short'.  
Perhaps you just never made it high enough in your career to interact with enough senior level colleagues. Speak to ANY black Bay-street lawyer (my mother being a black corporate lawyer) and they all have similar experiences.

No on is blaming white people for not succeeding but wake up to the world honey boo boo because bias is alive and well in hiring practices and if you don't think that's a problem then you simply are choosing to remain ignorant."
"I disagree, you have to look no further than many of the leaders of African American communities. People like Jesse Jackson, and Al Sharpton they hate white people. Period! How many of their leaders have talked reparations? Are you suggesting these black parents are teaching their children that the white people are holding them back or not treating them right. In my opinion the black communities are destroying themselves and they blame white people for it. 
You can call me a racist all you want but I know better, my best friend while serving in ""68"" was black and I trusted that man with my life and he trusted me. That is what set the tone for my opinion and actions for the rest of my life."

"So, you are calling Trump Hitler or his programs influenced by Hitler and the KKK?

There is nothing in the executive order that remotely suggest killing of Muslims or Blacks.  It is your brainwashed ideas put into your head by Obama/Clinton/Fake News, et. al.

"Do you think this might have something to do with the IDIOT pResident stepping in it, and since most of America did not vote for him and do not like him, that this was a natural result? What did this idiot pResident think was going to happen when instead of sitting down and shutting up for once, he had to try to rile up his racist base again?


Another point - only the most dishonest or the most ignorant claim that this is about ""disrespecting the national anthem"". It is about bringing attention to the fact that black lives matter, no matter how much it might make racists uncomfortable.


And as for whether Obama is ""black"" or not (according to you and other hairsplitters and concern trolls that seem tenaciously hung up on his white mother for some reason) hardly matters to the racists who are often going by the ""one drop"" rule and are still incredibly butthurt and #triggered over the fact that he served as POTUS for two terms."
"Joop - Its his ego saying: ""Blacks cant be THAT bad !"""

"Thank you for moving me into your opposition. From this point on, screw black people... I don't care anymore. I'm sick and tired of your crap... never again will I support you."
"I reject, completely and absolutely, your pathetic liberal diatribe as to why President Trump should not be invited to be Notre Dame's commencement speaker.  Your rationalization that Obama , in spite of being an open advocate and proponent for abortion, is more worthy than President Trump because he is black and has positions  'not that far out of the mainstream"" is spectacular in its absurdity.

It sicken and disturbs me that you are associated in any way, shape or form with the Catholic Church - perhaps you could find another 'faith' more accommodating to the mental masturbation you spewed above."
"Your statement shows how truly ignorant you are about the Proud Boys. First they have many gay members as well as several hispanic and black members and supporters. As for fighting. Of course especially since the fascistic antifa have been known to assault men and women, throw urine and attack using weapons. Darn skippy! Congratulations on accepting MSM's typical tact of lies and disinformation."
"It's weird how supposed ""patriots"" are out there defending the free speech rights of literal Nazis waving around a flag of a country and stupid ideology we spent a lot of blood and treasure to defeat, not to mention white supremacists waving around the flag of the TRAITORS - the Confederate flag, then turn around and whine when people respectfully protest the needless killing of black people by cops.


I don't think they have the least bit of principles and could care less about free speech. I think they are just plain racist."
"""they said, their presence to some black, gay or transsexual people was seen as threatening.""

Oh really, when a dangerous homophobic, racist nutter in the pride parade loses his steam and starts a brawl, who do these blacks and LGBT think will be the first in line to help bring the nutter to justice? Unicorns? Fairies? Tupac Shakur?"
"Of course the NFL wins the lawsuit, but NFL loses as this drags on in the media with black activist groups talking up the theory-conspiracy of collusion.  Black victimhood rolls on with the NFL on defense."
"Scumbags the lot of them!  You can pretty much guess what race these ""assistants"" are given the Gupta's predilection towards black employees and staff.  There will be no surprises as to how the ANCWL will react to this given their track record during Zuma's rape trial.

All of this just attests to the character of these cretins.  The proverb ""birds of a feather......"" just screams in ones face.  I'm starting to feel physically assaulted by the actions of these scumbags.  For the love of god will something just give already???  These cretins need to be run out of the country before there is absolutely nothing to save."
"Another Mo...it's always the Mo's that do this crazy crap...I hate black people that hate white people...just keeps going, and going and going..will it ever end with these Mo's?"
Where was tRump before he became an un-presidential candidate?  It was reported by a number of media outlets that blacks who worked in his casinos were order to stay out of sight anytime Trump and his then wife Ivana visited the casinos.  Come on black voters:  fool you once shame on you.  Fool you twice double shame on you.
"The fight of the Standing Rock and Blackfeet Sioux has nothing to do with your stupid white ""progressive"" causes. The elders asked you white protestors to go home. You are ignorant of your own history. It was ""progressive"" whites, Reconstructionists, that butchered 90% of my people. Your General Custer found gold in the Black Hills and your President Grant vacated the treaty signed with us and took that land for white settlers and miners. After the Civil War, you people abrogated virtually every treaty you had ever signed with Native American's. Remember the movement, a few years back, where blacks demanded the monitory equivalent of ""40'avres and a mule""? That was a promise General Sherman made to Buffalo Soldiers to join in slaughtering the Sioux, Shoshone, Nez Pierce, Crow, Blackfeet, and other Western people. Harriet Tubman, who Obama plastered on $20 bills, was the chief recruiter for Buffalo Soldiers. We don't want you or your government controlling how we live. Go away."
"Because Trump is a brazen racist and bigot, his problem about the news media isn't so much that there is anything false there; rather it is because the news reporters are Latinos and Blacks. That's his real problem and the same problem he had with President Obama. Obama didn't do anything for America; Obama was not born in America, etc., etc. That's what makes him angry."
"Massingale didn't say ""Whites and only whites are responsible for all the problems in America's black communities"" and you should be ashamed of saying he did.

Trid, you asked me about loving my neighbor, and I gave some examples where I find it hard to do that.  Here is an excellent example of my neighbor, utilitas, being unlovable."
"So, dbsb, you just as readily condemn blacks who rally because they want equality of treatment as you do white supremacists who want to enslave blacks whom they perceive as less than human? Clearly, you do. You're a racist, just like your boy, Top Chump Trump."
"""Reported"" by who? What ""document""?

Why are you talking about Martin Luther King? Did Moore try to get in his pants, too? What is your point? Are you saying that its OK for Moore to be a pedophile if Martin Luther King got it on with a bunch of women?

The statues argument is the most baffling to me. Taking down statues of confederate traitors because they literally celebrate racism and slavery is not equivalent to taking down statues of a man who championed tolerance and equality. Even if your fantasy story is true about King, its not relevant to his achievements. The confederate traitors' statues are literally trying to rewrite history.

Basically, you are a racist who thinks that if a black guy does something bad, that makes it OK for Roy Moore to be a pedophile."
"I find Trump despicable.  The people who listened on Trump's side of call, other than Trump, did not disagree with Rep. Wilson's response.
Your immediate turn to calling someone a greazy black sister indicates that you use race as a characteristic.

Don't bother to write back, not big on corresponding with racists."
Yet you protest the use of a death penalty on a black guy that shot up a chucky cheese's.   /sigh at more liberal hypocrisy.
"Oh FFS, this sh*t's never going to end. And the irony that the loons miss is how none of this, not one of their stupid, Marxist, Taliban-like 1984 idiocy will do a single thing for one black person. They'll still kill each other in urban cities, still resort to crime over education, and still have most of their children out of wedlock, born into poverty. 

Why do ""we"", the majority of reasonable Americans, continue to tolerate this crap, or worse enable it via silence?"
"Paul; Alethia, Its everything I can do after reading your comments, to not vomit. Im guessing your both in favor of the fascist transgender bathroom law, the Iranian giveaway deal, after which the Persian scumbags chanted death to America, and the apology tours, and pulling Americans out of the middle east, only to put them right back in. And a more divided country between whites and blacks than ever before, contrary to the promises obama made in his candidacy, and enacting more onerous regulations on corporate America than any other president in history. And now a SCJ thats charges money to hear her speak!!! What a disgrace! barak o is absolutley the worst prez that ever got elected in this great country, even worse than jimmy carter. and praise the lord, now we have sonia!!!"
"Right...that was prior to 2009, when a black guy became POTUS and lots of insecure white dudes lost their minds..."

"The ANC has deceived their own voters for long enough. They are the counter-revolutionaries here. Let Zuma come and call us Racists, we are not racists, we are South Africans and we have had enough of this Bullshit banana republic of Zupta. Zuma is a fool, who thinks he's still playing chess on Robben Island when in fact he's playing with the very lives of the voters who trusted him. Let the story of Zuma be a lesson to black people who vote for the ANC beacause it's the party that looks like them, next time I hope they would've learned to listen when we warn them not to vote for a criminal - 783 corruption charges - and a rapist. Hopefully the rapist Zuma has performed his final rape - that of our democracy."
"It's your contention that black Americans vote Democratic because ""welfare pays them to"". So what happened? It's your racist theory. Are you backing away from it now? Are you now actually of the opinion that black Americans might be complex human beings who are motivated by more than just ""welfare""?

You keep patting yourself on the back about what you tell your Republican friends about Latinos, but when you get on the internet, you tell the Denver Post readers that you think black and brown voters are one big monolith who vote 'cuz teh welfare. As I've said, you guys are your own worst enemy. Comments like yours are why I will NEVER vote Republican as long as you guys keep spouting such stereotypical, patronizing, inaccurate, racist garbage; I don't vote one way or the other because of welfare. I vote against the racist divisive party who thinks I'm an easily duped idiot."
".....But now you can't handle a talented rich black man talking back to your ridiculous leader.  Like all the overweight, white, stupid, racist, MAGAphants that attend his rallies, your life probably sucks and you're jealous of others that have made it through talent and hard work.  Poor baby, has the donald not made you rich yet like he promised?  What, no wall yet?  What, no coal mining jobs?  What, Obamacare still around.  You idiots who voted for him are being taken for a ride and you don't even know it.  But he sure has taught you how to be angry at the world and blame others for your plight."
"Was that before a black man went to an English court in Virginia and got it to ""award"" him, a former black indentured servant as a life-long  slave? (In the 1600's?  The 1st documented ""slave"" in the American colonies?) There were free blacks who owned black slaves.  Slavery was economic, not racial.  As for the 2nd amendment, neither the government nor the Constitution grant ""rights"". The Constitution lists the most important, which is directing the government to guarantee and protect them, nothing more or less! Man has had the natural right to self protection since the dawn of time.  And if you're referring to ""stealing"" a country (I'm assuming vis a vis the ""indians"") they weren't indigenous, they also came from somewhere else....and eliminated the peoples here before them.  Perhaps you should apply your same standards to the daily massacres committed BY blacks ON blacks in all  liberal controlled inner cities, like Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, etc.  liberals are such hypocrites."
"As a ""white guy"" I am getting a bit tired of being blamed for the stupid actions of others, if by others I mean black people.  There is an old saying you don't s____ where you eat.  These guys started this protest and the fans reacted to it.  A cable host last night offered them a venue to air their concerns on his highly rated show, that is where they should go to preach about the concerns they have, not by disrespecting the flag, country and fans. As far as Kiszla saying the players are acting more as adults than the President, they started this childish protest, I personally stand with the President on this one, don't disrespect the country that gives people the opportunity to become rich playing a game....."
"As always Ivanka is a low brow hypocrite. 

1. Her father courted the Alt-Right ""white nationalist"" movement (Bannon, Breitbart etc.) and continues to count them as worthy members of his coalition.

2. Her husband and herself are actively exploiting Daddy Trump's position to their advantage. 

3. So she is mad about anti-semitism but should we infer from her silence that the anti-mexican, black, muslim, trans rhetoric is ok with her?? 

4. This issue is not whether Daddy or Daughter Trump personally have animus to jewish people. What matters is that Trump's movement embraces, encourages and relies upon the extreme bigot vote, and has purposefully done so since the beginning. Half heatedly crying foul now is mealy mouthed hypocrisy."
"It is amazing how stupid and cowardly tancredo is and he got elected several times.
He was a draft dodger.
He knowingly hired illegals.
Even when pointed out that he had illegals, he did nothing to stop it.
Now, he thinks that first amendment applies to his wanting to force a company to hire a group that is about racism ( the illegal aliens is a front since they only care about Latinos, and blacks ).

Have to say, that I hope he runs on constitutional or even the Nazi party. Both are applicable to him."
"It's absolutely amazing to see the narrative of the media in the Las Vegas mass shooting.

If the shooter as a muslim, a mexican. a black or some other minority there would be howls of outrage and calls for reprisals against the group to which the shooter belonged. there would be calls for collective punishment - send them back; lock them up; deport them; ban them ...

But since the mass murderer is an elderly white male we have ""maybe he's got a brain tumor ... maybe there is a cover-up; maybe he's being framed by the deep state ...

The hypocrisy is glaring.

The traitorus acts of the Billionaire Class led by the Koch family, Oil Monopoly, Republican and Democratic Parties, Wall Street/Financiers.  The picture of a German president with tiny fist upraised like a spoiled child as he can't figure out whether to raise it in a Black Power salute or extend it for a full Nazi projection.  The fist ready to descend on the nation as it opens to grab every economic element available for the final looting envisioned by the Billionaire Oligarchy.  All courtesy of a brainwashed, manipulated stupid populace actually believing the words of this traitor.  Let the Women's March begin the revolution to take back the nation from the greedy fists of these worst traitors in the history of the nation."
"We dont know how many blacks in America voted for Trump but we do know many did, just as many women and gays did too . The problem is that they can't come out and say so. Putting a Trump sign on a lawn would have been  dangerous in Ferguson. For black Republicans, their homes would be burned,   their cars vandalized, and they would be beaten in the streets   by angry black thugs if they made their opinions known.   In  a twist of perverted modern racism, those black voters are now labelled white, and racists too."

They use this to divide us and make us weak, black vs. white or what about the fckin Indians.. Research world news right now, read the real stories! Our media is giving us a pacifier to suck on! This is not a fight of black, red or white OR rich or poor, this will be a fight to keep this nation alive. If you can't see that your blind and stupid because even a blind man can see in his heart."

"JimmyJ:  We are all familiar with self-deprecating humor.  Fat guys can make ""fat guy"" jokes; Jews can tell ""Jew jokes"", gays can tell ""gay jokes"", Mexicans can tell ""Mexican jokes"", an Italian can call another Italian a ""wop"";  and Black folks can call each other ""N$#$%er"". 

 I use my favorite scene from Owen Wister's ""The Virginian"" to explain what I mean.  The protagonist , the ""Virginian"" wins a big poker hand from the villian and the villian calls him an ""S.O.B.""  The Virginian responds ""smile when you say that.""  The message is so clear.  The key is INTENT.  Is the term used as an insult? Is it used to ""put down"" another person? Are you ""spoiling for a fight?""  Are you being patronizing?  or is the comment or joke truly friendly and innocent.  All key questions.  If a buddy of mine say ""Crum, you're such a #@% ,if a stranger says the same thing....that's a different ball game.  Does this make sense?  Gary Crum    p.s.

"The reaction has absolutely nothing to do with Boxing.

""We were looking for a thuggish Black man""

Good for the IRR. Maybe those fascist middle class UCT black students - especially that idiotic one with the 'Decolonised Science' rubbish - might actually learn something from this.

"That is the most racist piece of drivel I have read in quite some time.  It is EXACTLY that kind of demeaning and  bigoted racial crappola that got Trump elected.  Please keep it up the next 4 years so he can have eight in office.  SMH.  Btw, you do realize he did better with Blacks and Latinos than any GOP candidate in decades? Yea, its all about those evil white devils."
"yes they are despicable. the morons don't even state clearly what they are protesting. just racism, oppression, etc. so for the rest of time white people have to be reminded that they are oppressing blacks? when we are saddled with their crime? we're so sick of it. lift yourself up, don't wait for others. don't like the way police are treating you? STOP BREAKING the LAW! this article is just a suck up to the players. that's all the DP, 9news sports guys, and everyone else in denver does is suck up to the broncos."
"Yeah, all those black and brown ""liberals"" who are incensed at his comments about Mexicans being rapists, criminals,  etc. and mass deportatation, building a wall and so on as well as refusing to rent to blacks etc.  are wrong.  But good ole white Dave63 knows better than they do."
"How weak was this man assaulting a kid. Weak!! Just like George Zimmerman. Men address men.

As for you closet racists that want more articles on blacks assaulting each other and other white people, you are ignorant. Go to a black neighborhood and spew your hate or ignorance there and you'll probably get what you are looking for. It burns you up to hear about trash like yourselves in the news. Those crimes just aren't happening as much as you like to believe. Your types will probably have black grandchildren or great grandchildren soon anyway. Check our history books."

"I wrote not too long ago asking WHY were there no Black Catholic clergy present when Black PROTESTANT Ministers were protesting against racism and Trump? The succinct answer (the accurate one too, as I believe as well), was that THEY were afraid of their Conservative White  REPUBLICAN Bishops!

So despite Nazis and KKK marching and threatening to march and intimidate ALL those who don't look and act as THEY DO,  the Church's concern comes a little too late. Unless the Trump regime is publicly denounced in no uncertain terms and BLM is understood as a reaction to the shooting and defamation of unarmed Black Men, Women and Children rather than be blighly written off as a TERRORIST organization."

"I agree. 
The fact that someone could read this article and conclude that Ms. Roderique had everything 'handed to her"" only confirms the bias people such as herself have to deal with.
She is a black, female from a working class background. Her dad is a taxi driver. What part of this connotes privilege or a head start? Unbelievable comment.
Brains and hard work got her a long way. Her point is that these two ingredients alone -- sufficient for most white men -- were not enough to open all the doors for her as a black woman.
As she points out, homophily was the final barrier which she could not crack in her law firm.
Probably the best thing for her in the long run, however."

The fake news left out all the injured(by bats, pipes, clubs etc) in  the street because that would mean blacks, muslims and Soros paid anarchists were guilty, too. Nice."
I black and you are racist because you dare do your job. Never mind that I have sued multiple times and got lots of money.
"34,000 black Muslims belonging to black lives matters and the muslim brotherhood killing each other.

you just wrecked your sophist argument"
"What this is about is not superior nor inferior.  It is about not penalizing Asians who do well on an admissions test.  It is about how stupid it is to infer that whites would be upset if more Asians got into Harvard (or any college) if Asians did better on a test.  You took us down a rabbit trail because you tried to make an illogical leap about one race being inferior.  My final question to you is: why did you not include blacks in your ""inferior"" designation.  Why are only whites inferior to Asians?"
EXTERMINATE the NIGER RACE and their WHITE SCUM RACE TRADERS
"I didn't see the word black in this article. Or big bad. Or gangster thug. Just from you. I guess we all see whatever will push our agenda.  
""white dude crap"" really?"
"Dirty cops are all day, every day. So you're saying that the black community is causing (by ordering) police to contact them. I guess the solution is to get the black community to order police to stand down. Why are women more inclined to be raped? What is it that women are doing to make themselves be victims. I'm sure you have the answer. Help society out with the answer."

"Yeah, but swell guys like you only get upset when it's a woman (or worse yet, a BLACK woman) making sexist or racist comments.

Because he is black
"Leonard Pitts has written some of the most hateful rhetoric in published newspaper columns worldwide. He gets a free pass for his hate because he is ""black"". How do you like Trump now you racist and bigot!"
"The black criminal killed the innocent black man on the sidewalk.  

Your repetitive racist mantra is out of place."
"""...You are saying that extreme black on black violence and carnage is not news for the MSM.
Is that correct?...""

No, you're saying that to create something out of nothing.  If one isn't smart enough to dig deeper than the fluff that's thrown in their face by biased news media (which exists on ALL sides), then they're probably an idiot and not worth talking to.  

The problems in Chicago do not preclude the problems in Charlotte, the idiocy of Trump, any extreme left wing group that supports racist behavior, or any reprehensible behavior at all.  Even a person of average intelligence can consider many issues without having to exclude the others.  

The problem we're dealing with here is that those with questionable behavior immediately deflect and try to point at problems elsewhere, and those that support them do the same.  Reality is Trump is a racist who is supported by racist morons and he didn't have the courage to call them out, just as many other politicians have done."
"Didn't think the police arm themselves to kill Jews, Blacks, and any other races opposed to white supremacy."
"According to those same statistics just under 16% of homicides of whites were committed by blacks.  So, white people are at far greater risk of being killed by other white people than by black people."
"Statistics show blacks commit 6x the rate of murder of whites, so."
"Schumer offers all generalizations and zero solutions!   Where is this guy for the 1,000's that are being shot and killed in Chicago? Zero solutions for black on black crime- but here he is complaining about a responsible organization like the NRA... Here is the stupidity behind his argument- Kill Babies its a woman's right, ban guns they kill people?  And spoons make people fat, cars drive drunk, and rental trucks should be banned!  So completely political...I would love to hear any argument for any solutions besides blah blah blah same old useless democrat talking points"
"Nah, the racists just got very, very #triggered by having a black man in office. Obama was grace under pressure and bent over backwards (too much if you ask some) to his opposition.



But racism is fundamentally rooted in stupid, and it's very hard to fix stupid. Even having a black president wasn't going to change the dark hearts and befuddled minds of the right wingers that loathe someone like him for his skin color, and hate him all the more for his skill, his intelligence, and his success."
Still trying to control the lives of black people.
"Urine idiot! This was all started because blacks want to be able to rob 7-11's and not be arrested. 'You people' are good at twisting facts to suit your own needs and wants, but many of us remember!"
"Meanwhile, in Chicago, 58 people were shot with hand guns in the last week.  But who cares about black people, right?"
"Right, so only blacks killed by whites should be protested. I get it. Sorry to bring up black on black murders."
"Our local Muslim community doesn't appear to be either racist or otherwise bigoted. Of America's 3.3 million Muslims, a large number are African-Americans. Africa itself has for a thousand years been home to millions of Moors, black peole who aren't Aryan and who are welcome as pilgrims to Mecca. What is obvious is that those in America who hate Muslims for whatever reason (and I include you, dogs, among the bigoted haters) are the real hateful, bigoted, ignorant sociopaths, people who murder peaceful Muslims out of sociopathic hatred. Such people don't know what it means to be an American."
Well the license to not only kill black people was signed with the Philando Castile murder nut now the license to hunt black people up and put them in prison has been signed. Stop and frisk is back with a new name. Lynch them with bullets is the law.
"The democratic (old white folks) party found that it has no place in a young and progressive America.

Hillary's losers need to accept their loss humbly, not don black hoods and attack any conservative they can find."
All Republicans have for black people are bullets. They have given Democrats a pretty low bar to get over to look less racist than Republicans.
"when they go after black people who dye their hair blond, ill take them seriously"
"Trump could tell his crowd that black is white and they would 'believe' it. Not about black people of course, Americans will never accept that blacks are people."
"1/2
So as a Black kid and later teen during that time, forgive me if I took offense. See, I have this thing about White opportunistic politicians calling Black kids ""animals"" and demanding their deaths for crimes they didn't even commit. I kind of feel like they're talking about me, and I have a real problem with that. So as far as I'm concerned, both Shillary and Trump are racist cynical scum. NEITHER will get my vote! There is no real choice in this sham of an election. I also don't like White guys pretending that they're Black online, claiming to speak for Black people."
"You need to get your movement going to keep blacks, Hispanics, and gays in their rightful place."
"Except they can, and do. You assume its because the person is black, which makes you the very definition of racist. It could be because of literally ANY OTHER REASON AND THERE WOULDNT BE A DAMN THING YOU COULD DO ABOUT IT."
"I'll try to post this again. Star-Advertiser IS MONITORING and DELETING our post. Thanks SA for steering​ the conversation.   
Black Lives Matter Protesters Chant 'Pigs In A Blanket, Fry 'Em Like Bacon!' KILL THE COPS!
Are you OK with this?"
That makes it 60 times more for black males compared to white female murderers.
"Well, the extra level of insult is that not only is your spouse having it off with someone else, but with ...one of THOSE PEOPLE.  Plays into a few stereotypes about black males, too."
"Melanin isn't the deciding factor either. Despite the excessive dividing up of the human race these days there are really only 3 primary races:

Mongoloid, Caucasoid and Negroid. Colloquially, Asian, White and Black. After that is it mixes and subcategories of race and, more prominently, cultures. Faber would have been more accurate saying Western European culture or European culture instead of White and it would have been less inflammatory. You can say very little favorable about ""White"" people or people with white skin these days without being crucified as a racist. It is idiotic."
Black Lives Matter is a joke. Where are they when black people kill other black people?
"Black, of course... These people don't belong in a civil society. They should be repatriated with the African continent so they can behave like savages and be comfortable hacking each other to death with machetes."
You left out all the blacks killing other blacks.  I don't see them protesting the over 3000 blacks shot by other blacks in Chicago this year.
Typical white nationalist President — having a bad week and seeking the support of his racist base by attacking black people. It seems to happen every week now.
"Ten of thousands must have colluded to ""rig"" the election,  most all of them ""deplorables"" described variously as white racists,  poor people trying to survive,  red necks,  anti muslim fascists,  you get the drift.   They provided the electoral college votes that win elections.  Hence,  spending too much time in adoring states like California and Minnesota,  Illinois,  wasted Democrat time and resources,  but  provided a popular vote win,  which means as much as being the best looking person on death row,  or dying with a billion dollar fortune.  So what?  Meaningless.

So if you don't think the fake news dossier on Trump and his claimed sexual adventures wasn't pursued and gobbled up by the DNC,  we haven't been reading the same news accounts.   Vile,  disgusting,  and not a shred of truth to it,  but bandied about as ""the truth.""   So let's cut  the   ""pot calling the kettle black"" crap,  and hope the jr. high Congresspersons  get off their smart phones soon, and go to work."
"Fine. But it has to work all ways.
No Asian can every play a role designed for a non Asian.
No Woman can ever play a role designed for a man and vice versa.
And why stop there: no woman can ever write from the male perspective.
No one can every write what non immigrants, or old immigrants 'feel' about new immigrants.
No black person can every write anything depicting the thoughts or actions of a white person.

You see how ridiculous this all is?"
She is the black equivalent of a white supremacist. Substitute White  for Black  and you have the  KKK.
Please back up your statement that HPD currently brutalizes black and hispanics!  Or is diarrhea spewing from somewhere?
"Wow!!  More leftard garbage.  Trump defended himself from an ad hominem attack, big difference from ""lashing out.""  Secondly, this pile might even make sense if millions of black Americans hadn't voted for Trump.  Time to stop the #FakeNews and race baiting and get on with accepting YOU LOST!  YOU'RE FIRED!!"
"Absolutely right! We don't care if your black, brown, white , green or even red, if your wrong you pay the price. Don't even go there with that race card crap!!!"
The discrimination against males in colleges is based on Title 9 interpretation by the Democrats in the position of power that are controlling 100% of Higher Education. The ratio of males to females in colleges is dropping from 4 to 6 to 3 to 7. It will lead to the demographic disaster as Men tent to marry down and women to merry up. A college educated female will not marry a plumber or HVAC technician. Virtually all college educated females will remain spinsters or will be forced to whore around for companionship. One only needs to examine African American marriage patterns to see the future. Why would a college educated Black MD marry an ex con?
"That view is also shared by many black Americans, both Trump supporters and detractors, you racist"
">>Yet in the face of that disturbing evidence,

.
Evidence to what?

Blacks and Jews are the groups most targeted by hate crimes. The two-fold increase is +20 incidents, if i remember correctly.

The increase comes largely in the ""against property"" group.

Does this diminish any of the crimes?  No.

Does it constitute a 'quell'? No.

60 idiots threw a slur, or felt 'macho' by vandalizing a mosque, or pulled Muslim woman's headscarf (these mostly done by teenagers).

That constitutes calling Canadians Islamophobic?"
"How many times have we heard the Left (Democrats/Liberals) in the United States, Canada and worldwide state repeatedly, not to hate Muslims, Jews ,Gays, Blacks and just about every other part of humanity?! How many times?! How many times?!

Yet, how many times have we heard Democrats/Liberal politicians, world political leaders of every stripe, the news and broadcast media, talk show hosts, T.V. and movie stars and private citizens both in the United States of America, Canada and around the world spew hatred and condemnation toward American President Donald Trump feeling that is all prim and proper?!

Like the Islamic terrorists who are radicalized by I.S.I.S. in mosques all over the world, those people who I have mentioned above that hate President Trump to such an extreme, are certainly responsible for radicalizing the gunman, James T. Hodgkinson. You have fueled this hatred and indignation by the words from your own mouth.

Yes, you asinine hypocrites have blood on your hands."
"Black Lives Matter is for people who get shot and killed for simply for being black, or when LEO uses excessive force when dealing with them because of their skin color. BLM is not for drug dealing criminals that choose the thug life to scream poor me, I'm going to jail because I'm black. No, you are going to jail because you are a criminal."
"Obama brought racism back by being black! Obama was subjected to racism no other US President has had to face. The right creates the racist discord by spreading racist conspiracy theories like ""birtherism"" then chides Obama for not doing anything about fixing the racism in this country...The idea of a black man in the White House is abhorrent to some people it seems..."
"Apparently if someone is black, the LEOs are not allowed to protect anyone else from his butcher knives.

What a farce."
"Yeah, them blacks sure be stupid about that ""unspoken"" problem.  Not like whites who put athletes like Gretzky on a pedestal.

"I heard Republicans were barricaded inside polling stations with orders to shoot to kill any black, hispanic, poor  or elderly person who looked like a Democrat who tried to vote.  Only white Republicans waving the Confederate flag  were allowed in to vote. That is what this story is all about. . Yup ."
"“Demonstrators shouted slogans such as ‘black lives matter’”

BALDERDASH!

If black lives were not dirt cheap - - if black lives REALLY mattered to the blacks themselves - - two things not true now WOULD be true:

[1] young women would demand the fathers of their children marry them and remain faithful BEFORE the arrival of the children

[2] they would demand that Planned Parenthood  - - which deliberately locates its for profit abortion mills in high density black communities to kill as many black babies as possible - -  be de-funded and abolished."
"What a sadly narrow view of the world.  Nothing in this letter but Fox News half-truths.  Obama took policemen to task who shot un-armed people because they were black.  Jumping from a patrol car and gunning down a 12 year old boy playing with a toy gun IS an act of stupidity, or murder.  And if that doen't bother you then you have no soul."
"A show of unity? No. It was treating white players and military veterans like crap to appease racist black players that aren't capable of professionalism if it hit them in the skull. 

This was nothing less than racial pandering to keep black players from causing problems."
Please get back to us when white people are killed as a personnel management tool. That was what the lynching of black people was about. Lynching was a population control tool.
Wby don't you educate your redkneck self. How do you know he was high? Because someone said it on here or was it since he is black you just assume he is high? Do us a favor and go jump off a cliff hick
"If blacks admit Obama was a failure, they fear there will never be another black president. So they reverse Uncle Tom to remain hopeful."
"Wow. Just wow.  Black women feel more pain than this pig would ever be able to endure. Take it down. (And the speculum is an instrument of torture in the hands of most doctors, particularly the males.) They also say certain parts feel no pain. To this day. Surprise, man beasts!"
"Even if he DID call the cops, against her wishes, they couldn't have done anything about it. Reporting a crime against a third party, free of corroborating evidence - of which there was none - is not actionable as it's investigative-hearsay. It's not like seeing a crime on the news and saying 'I know that guy, I'm going to call in a tip,' that's offering third-party information to aid in an investigation. Here, there wasn't an investigation, as there was no report of a crime.
Kizsla is salivating over every purported act of impropriety around CU. Could you imagine his mock outrage had CU taken against Tumpkin, based on the available information: ""CU's racist policies call for black coach to be fired based on unsubstantiated reports!"" Or, ""CU deprives black coach of due-process!"" The slander/libel lawsuits that Tumpkin would have (regardless of his actual involvement) had would dwarf the current allegations - and Kizsla would have been drooling the whole time. He's a pathetic individual"
So trans-gendered people cannot defend the US and fight? Used to say that about black people and women. Discrimination is discrimination.
"Ignorant millionaire athletes supporting a false narrative and a Black Lives organization that is both racist , violent and Marxist.
I will support everyone's right to free speech on their own time but using the NFL and national TV to disrespect my flag and the flag of a country that has done more to advance freedom and true equality then any other is malignant stupid. There is no epidemic of police violence against black men, there is an epidemic of violent black men."
"It might be considered important - but is it really? Maybe it's because the woman is black, or Muslim, or has a ""save the whales"" bumper sticker, or even a Confederate flag on her bumper. The point is - it's not OK to run people over because of their beliefs. Trump seems unable to condemn such behavior convincingly.

OTOH - yeah, this story is incomplete. Maybe she crossed in front of him while he was driving and he just made a stupid comparison."

"The Trump years are a waste of four years. Trump is not great. What is notable with Trump is he is a incessant liar and not particularly competent. Mexico is not paying for his wall. And his failure to come up with a viable alternative to Obamacare was a reflection of his lack of knowledge and leadership on policy matters. Ryan and McConnell wrote the legislation behind closed doors rather than holding open Congressional hearings. Trump was wasting his time golfing and watching television since it was an embarrassment for him to talk publicly or privately about the subject given how stupid he is. Trump bought his college degree. He did not earn it. 

Trump is not inspirational and lacks legitimacy. Most of his opinions are driven from his racist point of view that blames immigrants, blacks, and Mexicans as the source of all troubles. So it is not surprising that he supports the Klan and its attempts to rename itself as the alt-right. And he failed to win the popular vote."

“White ppl are recessive genetic defects. this is factual, white ppl need white supremacy as a mechanism to protect their survival as a people because all they can do is produce themselves. black ppl simply through their dominant genes can literally wipe out the white race if we had the power to.
“What wypipo don’t understand is that this is not like our elder’s movement. We will snatch your edges and clap you back into ashes. We will also beat that ass Becky. Run up.”

"While margaret sanger believed in eugenics, her approach was recognized as not being specific to race.  She believed in the importance of birth control for both white and black women as the only practical way to avoid unplanned pregnancies and subsequent abortions.  

Unfortunately for women, religious conservatives oppose both contraceptives and abortions.  Their only solution seems to be to tell women to cross their legs.  Or, in the case of republican congressman tim murphy, hypocritically oppose abortion for everyone else but encourage his mistress to get one when he thought she was pregnant.  Meanwhile, religious conservatives have gotten into bed with the devil when they supported the thrice married, pu**y-grabbing, misogynistic trump.  Sad!"
This is easy to understand. In any jury of 12 people there will always be one white person who will refuse to convict a white cop of killing a black man. That is the United States. You will never see a white cop convicted of murdering a black man no matter what the evidence is.

Now loot at the stats for the percentage of black people and their involvement in crime, it surpasses white people.  This isn't a white / back thing and a tit for tat game.  A high percentage of black people condone criminals in their community, they have rules of ""no snitchin"" and un cooperation with the police as a status symbol.  A kid will get murdered or their will be other criminal behavior,  a victim will run to the police and say solve it.  The police ask for help and  get none, they now have to diligently rule out people.  So, they contact people they feel may be involved, those people feel persecuted.  Guess what, you condone the neighbor criminal you know is involved and invite the police to harass that segment of the neighborhood.   It's that easy, the football players know it but it's easier to blame the police."

No matter what is really happening they are brainwashing most black people into thinking that they are the only ones that are ever detained by police, arrested by police,  stopped for a broken tail lightor expired tags  by police, stopped for fitting the description of a perp by police,  or shot and killed by police.    They refuse to admit that happens   to people  of any other color and that it happens just as regularly to white people as it does blacks because they brainwash other blacks to fear for their lives with their rhetoric........and  it doesn't fit their ""revolutionary"" agenda if they were to admit it.  
Screw BLM.   They are nothing but terrorists themselves."
"Charles Dalton has never said anything racist that I have ever read. By the way, hate to burst your bubble but there is no such thing as ""race"" so Mr. Dalton couldn't be a disgrace to the ""black race"" since there is no such thing. Similarly, there is no ""white race."" You do not employ any football players because you do not own a football team. You pay for admission to watch a football game and have no say in the terms of employment for the unionized players. Also, this probably hard for a person as delusional as you to accept but it's not ""your flag"" any more than it's Colin Kaepernick's. 
It could be that you hyperventilate over issues related to the flag because deep down you know that you sacrificed your health by fighting in a war for abstract and mostly empty ideals. America is more free by function of what people did in the Civil Rights movement than by function of what was accomplished in any recent war. 
No flag is large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people."
"Regarding this->  ""tired white guy like you."" That XRay vision of yours is seriously malfunctioning.  
(Mine musta broke, otherwise I could write ""tired old black woman like you"" right?!  Haa haaa!)

Why is it that Colin Kaepernick now will stand for our National Anthem if someone will sign (pay/hire) him, and yet before, he would not? See, I can spell hypocrite and I can define the word too.

"Yet the belief endures, from an earlier age until today, that visible, affluent African-American entertainers are obliged to adopt a pose of ceaseless gratitude, appreciation for the waiver that spared them the low status of so many others of their kind.
Stevie Wonder began a performance in Central Park Saturday night by taking a knee, prompting Congressman Joe Walsh to tweet that Wonder was “another ungrateful black multi-millionaire.”
Ungrateful is the new uppity.
Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans.
Thus, the wonder is not the unhinged behavior of that week but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment."
Really?  Then why is the NRA not standing up for the black man that legally possessed a concealed weapon and was shot and killed when he was trying to retrieve his ID seems to me if it was a white guy that was shot the NRA would be standing out screaming but since it was a black guy you haven't heard a word out of the NRA about the persons right to a Concealed weapon and not be shot and killed by the police remember the black man was a legal gun owner   With a legal concealed permit  he was following instructions reaching for his ID which was in his back pocket when he was shot repeatedly by some loser cop......

"People who expected the election of President Barack Obama to lead to racial healing and a post-racial society failed to take account of his far left political agenda. Barack Obama has mastered the art of keeping Black voters aroused while keeping white voters soothed — thanks in part to the gullibility of the public, who mistake his geniality and glib rhetoric for honesty and good will. 

Your beloved Barack Obama is not going away though. He will be resuming his community organizing as a race hustler keeping Black people fearful, angry, resentful, and blaming Whitey to keep them as a Democrat party dependency class  voting block to constantly reelect all those Congressional Black Caucus parasites who just live high on the hog off the government while doing absolutely nothing for the Black Community.  And he will go on the speaking circuit internationally undermining the President and badmouthing his own country while advocating one world government under the United Nations/"

"You threatened to kill people when  you made this statement. ""Except maybe criminals who have to consider whether their next victim is packing heat. Which by the way, I don't. Probably."" Too many of you white folks refuse to take responsibility for your choices. I consider the GOP, in the 21st century, to be little more than a white identity death cult. You love being white and armed more than being human beings or Americans. You have made it clear that you have no problem taking a human life. Do you support the state sponsored killing of unarmed black people? BTW, you didn't respond to my comments about the Vietnam war. Are you not brave?"
"That is ridiculous in so many ways that there isn't room to reply adequately.  To begin with, have you ever been to private schools?  And you are lumping in the few private academies with private schools located in many typical neighbor hoods through out the city.  You are also putting typical liberal stigma on blacks and other minorities that they all live in poor neighborhoods with those like them.  I guess my nephews black wife, who grew up in a south suburb wasn't informed that her family was in the wrong neighborhood and needed to move to Montbello.  I suggest you go to Lincoln Academy and see the cross-section of society that attends there.  In the end, you are so narrow minded on this subject that you can see through a keyhole with both eyes."
"Very true. Exactly. Parents who teach their kids to look for fake racism are horrible parents planting the seed of victimhood in their kids. It's awful and messes the kid up to the point where someone like this woman can have everything and still feel like a victim of some fake nonsense she has created in her head and looks to explain every incident in her life as racism. She doesn't get her pizza on time it must be because somehow the pizza place knew she was black and they hate black people. Someone steps on her toe in the elevator, first check their race, if they're not black then they stepped on your foot because your black and they hate black people.  She has to wait in line at walmart it must be because she's black because white people don't wait in line ups obviously. She's self absorbed and paranoid and feel cozy and secure in a world where when she doesn't get what she wants, how she wants, it and when she wants it then it's because she's black. She's a trouble maker!"

"Another right winger tightly clinging to monuments to anti-black bigotry. 

So many people so desperate to venerate white supremacy. It's amazing to see so many Coloradans so invested in the treasonous anti-black Confederacy. It's not even Colorado history. It's like Arizona refusing to take down their Confederate monuments. Arizona? Confederate monuments? WTF?

That's when you know that white supremacy is a nationwide drug that fuels too many white backlash ""freedom loving patriots"". They would rather venerate a racist anti-American rebellion than finally fulfill the ideas of Reconstruction and accept black Americans as equal citizens."
How about being black? Are you fine with that? Something tells me deep down you are not.

"the real reason for trumpy's success is his appeal to racists and bigoted americans who disliked president Obama and rise of blacks in the federal government and power.  their real slogan is to make America white again, which in their minds will make America great again.  they don't like blacks telling them what to do.  all of trumpy's policy reflects this attitude to make America white again.  let's call a spade a spade, he is a bigot and wants to take America back to the slavery days, when whites males ruled the country."
Black lives matter is a joke when you look at statistics  and hear their argument that it is the white man oppressing them. Come on folks how many years are we going to continue this I'm a minority and life isn't fair to me. If you need someone else to take care of your issues your not equal to someone that does it themselves.
People once chose to believe black humans were property. They minimized it in their minds to conceal and deal with the legal crime of their time.
"You're saying MASS PROTESTS by entire teams, disrespecting the national anthem, started on Obama's watch? Yeah, I don't think so. We'd have heard about it in the news - and it never happened. But feel free to make up your own ""facts"" as you see fit.

And Obama isn't ""black"" he's mulatto...that is, a person with one black parent and one white parent. ""Black"" means you have two black parents and ""white"" means you have two white parents. Again, feel free to make up your own facts, like Obama having a black father AND a black mother."
"I can only judge your attitude from what you say here.  

Racial Bigotry is your hallmark.  

No black person has ever been a success in the US because of white racism.  No black person ever can be a success because of 300-year old white racism which will continue into perpetuity.

Every single person who did not vote for Hillary Clinton was a racist, ignorant, uneducated Klansman.   

Every white person only succeeds because a black person is persecuted.

That is you.

I'm glad that during my twenty years in the military I met real black people who were able to make it on their own and succeed without the crutch of  'affirmative action'.  

One of my better company commanders was black.  I met him when he was a Lieutenant and got to serve under him when he made Captain and got to go to his retirement ceremony when he was a Full Bull Colonel.  

He was a Man, not some  wimp relying on the crutch of racist hatred to justify his failures in life.

(Oh.  His wife was white, too.)"
Another case of black at the wrong time.

"oh my god, stop with the accusations. of course I oppose racism of all kinds. I have not seen this echo chamber of hate in the comments section at Breitbart. Canadians are such virtue signalling, sensitive, control freaks. I simply am of the opinion that free speech is free, and there isn't as much racism in the USA as you make out. Studies have shown 95% of Americans agree with black/white marriages. I have traveled often to the USA. The site is far more libertarian than it is alt right. ""Dangerous faggot"" refers to Milo Yiannopolous who is their gay editor and is not racist.

What 'trash talk' ... If the story is full of rhetoric & subtle bigotry, then is it discarded.

The breakdown of the Human Race into Browns, Blacks, Purples, Yellows, Reds & Whites, et al --is a creation of Human Imagination. The anthropological categories for the Human Race exist due to the melanin & environmental features evolved for both Human skin & physical characteristics -- not the pejorative dumbed down 'colour coding' created by Americans black activists back in the swingin' sixties.

So, how about we present for scrutiny both Human cultural advancement & intellectual development -- Gee, isn't the Western Civilization is popular place to be.

Frankly, the 'Human Brain' remains the 'Same' .. unless backfilled with the long-time simmering prejudice  of the Browns, Blacks, Purples, Yellows, Reds & Whites -- then the hatred of 'racism' needs to be the label that is worn by Any/All of these groups.

"I think what we have here is a case when a coach gets so frustrated at the fact that his team (which he as probably seen play very aggressive against teams that mirror them) got on the court against a predominately if not all African American Team and wanted no parts of the competition physically. In a attempt to say hey fellas its basketball, hello!!! don't be afraid of them cause they don't look like you. Please fellas it can't be because they don't look like you. Damn it, it is. I can't believe this ish! Can you envision the frustration a coach could have if he believes his team is not playing defense because they don't want to touch a kid that is umm ""black."" Is this a far fetched assumption by coach Adelman? Did he handle it correctly, not sure but......"
"Exactly. The ""not guilty"" verdict brought black neighborhoods close to riot. Obama spoke calmly and sensibly; Obama poured oil on troubled waters, soothing the unhappy situation. Trump on the other hand, has doubled down on his truly nasty characterization of black athletes protesting police brutality and murder against ""their people"" (remember that most of those athletes come from disadvantaged neighborhoods) and in fact, as anyone can plainly see today, further divided our nation of blamers and finger-pointers.

Obama didn't ""screw up"", you and millions of other bigots who loudly proclaimed ""the black kid deserved to die"" REALLY screwed up. And all from the relative safety of your barcolounger, where you judge the world in all your heralded wisdom. No doubt you get tremendous satisfaction every time a creep with a gun shoots down an unarmed black kid. I know I'm right, there."

Ignorance is bliss if you are white. Did you know that the Electoral College was created to defend race based slavery?  It still supports white racism today. That is how we got Trump when Clinton had 2.8 million more votes than Trump. White racism is alive and well in the USA. What black person would tell you what they think of you? That has always been a good way for a black man to get himself killed in this country.

There were extremely few people that Trump could have defeated, and Obama was not one of them."

How about the black Chicago Judge killed in his driveway today?  Does his life matter?  

None of them were killed by Trump voters or police officers as near as we can tell.  Do their lives still matter?

Hold off  on answering,   We don't know yet if the dead eight-year old is black or not.    Lots of the kids in the class were.

According to the DOJ, blacks commit over half of all murders despite the fact that they make up about 13% of the US population. The media likes to downplay black murders with the narrative that blacks primarily only kill other blacks. This is just not true. About 9-10% of all murders committed in the USA are blacks killing non-blacks."
"A Trump win will mean the beginning of the end of a not-so-great nation, one that was borne of slavery and wanton Native American killings from one end of America to the other. 

A Trump win will be the death knell of this nation. A Trump win will see chaos and death for millions of Black and Brown people at the hands of a White Power nation that has it in for people who don’t look like Trump. I see no joy in the coming months and years."
"http://www.amren.com/news/2015/07/new-doj-statistics-on-race-and-violent-crime/
New DOJ Statistics on Race and Violent Crime

This table can be used for a number of interesting calculations. First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.

Interestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time."

Blacks want to work they are tired of this drug war. How can they when immigrants bring the drugs while they get the jobs. It's time to stop and think black folks. This is the reason why they want to bring these drugs here. For black folks to kill themselves. While they take over this sanctuary city. If Trump don't fund Chicago sanctuary city. That's o.k. to Emanuel he got money saved for immigrants. In Chicago.  I remember when the city of Chicago was built by blacks and whites. The immigrants got the city jobs now. Don't let these immigrants get the jobs and learn ur sewer system cause that's how they sneaking in immigrants with what y'all allow them to learn. They will use it against you.

Pretty damn callous.  Maybe these guys would have let a white guy drown, but seems less likely.  Anyway, since then the feds are looking at it.

If I grant you that the left has more track record of destroying property, maybe its because the right sets up more symbols to be resented (and feared, if you look at it from a dominance perspective).  But on the other hand, I googled ""MLK statue defaced"" and came up with stories from Ohio, Philly, Houston -- and that was just page 1.  Black churches have been fire bombed.

"Re: ""Why are conservative student organizations routinely referred to as ""hate groups"" and bastions of ""white supremacy?"" 

Because the liberal media are directing our attention to it, and not directing our attention to the white supremacy established by liberals.

Decades ago liberals created a monument of sorts that still operates in a stealth way to produce an insidious racist effect -- of maintaining white supremacy -- worse than any produced by a conservative or a bronze confederate monument.

And they have not told black Americans about it.

An excellent question. I think further action is warranted. Don't you? I think Trudeau should show his commitment to diversity and step down and allow a woman to lead the Liberal party and Canada. A black bisexual FN lacto-ovarian vegan Woman. Perhaps with a disability or two. I mean come on Mr. Trudeau - put your money where your mouth is. Or are the rules about diversity just for everybody else?
"I have no problem with those subjects being included as long as you also include that Blacks were also slave holders and native americans also killed each other and took each other's lands.  Just because the white man conquered the continent it doesn't make the history of pre-white invasion any different.  It just means that the white man had better technology and won once they showed up.  And yes, many whites also committed atrocities against the natives.  But guess what, they happened before whites showed up too.  This kind of thing was happening all over the globe.  Japan ruled the orient with an iron fist. They devastated China and Korea.

So teach all of history as long as you don't focus on any one group."

It's a messy, (mostly) gray world out there -- I'd say we should spend less energy trying to delineate our enemies from our allies and more energy seeking common ground and respectful dialogue. But to each their own -- you do you, and if black-and-white helps you sleep at night, knock yourself out."

"Trump's ascension was a direct result of Tea Party, evangelical, and white backlash against disorderly Blacks, Mexican immigrants, a decline in sexual mores and rise of gay marriage. It has been harbored and nurtured as anti Obama and anti woman (especially Hillary Clinton) hate. But most important, it has fostered a hate for the poor, the disabled, the homeless, the sick, the aged, and anyone else in need. These needy folk have been disowned as ""unworthy"" of our concern and suffering from self-inflicted troubles. There is then no mercy - it is their fate until they pray themselves up from their own boot-straps."

It seems that I, a fellow citizen – unlike my Black friend – and others who think like me, live in quite a different universe where we know that much of what is going on in Zuptaland (including in the African National Congress) is wrong, indefensible and terribly harmful to the nation and all its peoples.

"We see how justice proceeds very differently depending on who you are and who your friends are.  If a black man had grabbed $100 from a bank teller and run, he'd probably get years in prison.  This woman stole thousands and thousands and has her wrist slapped with a wet noodle."
"You've gotta be kidding.  Let me simplify a bit for you:

If slavery is bad, why pray tell are the Muzzies still selling people?  Why is that ok?  And for a bonus score, why is Islam now a popular lifestyle choice among a certain percentage of American blacks?

Nazis are National Socialists.  The only socialists killing people these days are Bernie supporters.  Or are National Socialists worse than socialists in your world.  For extra credit, why?

Final question:  If racism is bad (you mentioned it at least twice), why is BLM and La Raza (The Race) good?  Cheers -"
"I'll see your murder-suicides and raise you ten or more dead little girls shot in their beds through the walls of their houses by gang bangers-- Black, Hispanic and Asian, spraying their own neighborhoods with random shots while high on drugs.  

And the Black ones wearing ""Warn-A-Brother"" T-Shirts to threaten the good, honest, people in the neighborhood so they won't testify against the scum. 

FBI statistics say those are the deaths; the victims are the same race as the murderers.

You didn't like the Chicago Tribune articles that showed those facts when I published them here on CC; I can go to a different city...."
"This whole debate is a classic example of American politics above self-interest.  What critically thinking American of either political stripe would support legislation that does nothing to actually improve the Affordable Care Act?

Oh yeah, that's right, though it has real flaws that could be corrected, the ACA like a lot of other things from the Obama years must be bad simply because That Black Man brought it in while he ruined America.

And shame on the Press for not digging into this more deeply but rather spending most of their time on the stupid meetings-with-Russians affair."
"Yes ............... 
A black guy more than tripled those markets in only 8 years
............. and all you saw was negative this, that and the other"
In her case parole is just a word. It means nothing. I hope she doesn't have a boyfriend. She should have a black widow tattooed on her forehead to warn any men she comes across.
"This DA's office sounds like real jewels.  From back in March - 

A Washington County prosecutor’s internet post defending racial profiling has some local defense attorneys concerned.

Deputy District Attorney Zoe Smith is “on board” with “the anti-politically correct movement to support Trump,” Smith wrote recently on her Facebook page. She added, “If you’re looking for a terrorist, look at a young Muslim male. If you’re looking for a gang shooter, look for a young black guy. If you’re looking for a child molester or a mass shooter, look for a white guy. That’s just common sense.”

So it makes sense that they'd be soft on someone who acts just like the candidate they support."
"Are you suggesting that Trump is so mentally feeble that a supposed (unproven) reference by Clinton in 2008 is enough to send him off on a five-year public crusade to lie about and delegitimize the nation's first black president? 

I think you're right, and it also can explain Trump's other odious views. A sort of unified field theory explaining the poor man's delusions. 

Good job, Dogs."
"Obama has done such a horrible job and been an absolutely useless President....  race relations worse now than for the last 50 years, highest number of people who want to work but can not find a job, highest number of people on food stamps, number of illegals has grown to over 20 million, US reputation around the world has diminished, advancement of pussification of people rampant, etc. etc. etc.
NAME ONE ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT HIS FANS CAN CELEBRATE...  other than trying to destroy the society of the US.
Want to know why Obama is not moving back to his ""hometown"" where a lot of his fans are and basis of this pablum story? Too friggin dangerous as people get killed there... almost all black on black crime... every day and all the time.  If Obama was a real person and not the ""emperor has no clothes"" guy, he would move back there and try to fix Chicago. But, not Obama.... now that they are millionaires... who cares."
"How is my scenario irrelevant? He is proud if it goes to a heterosexual wedding but disgraced it the same thing goes to a gay wedding? 

Why would he take less pride in his “work of art, custom cake” if all of a sudden it is used in a gay, satananic wedding?
The baker is choosing to be offended. 

Is the baker going to ask people if they are gay before agreeing to make a custom cake?
He is being a petty child.

So what if you think the cake is art? I am not going to argue that with you. 
Do you think artists are allowed to discriminate?

If an artist sells to the general public, the artist can not discriminate against protected classes.
If the baker wins, it will be legal to discriminate based on religion. I guarantee you black people will be denied service somewhere on religious grounds. 

You can make all the semantic arguments you want. The baker discriminated, no one is arguing that. 
He offers custom cakes to divorcees and adulterers, but not to homosexuals. He is a hypocrite."
Do the newspapers report the race of a cop who shoots a deadly gangster black guy?  YES THEY ALWAYS DO.  The only reason not to show a picture and report the race is RACISM to hide the TRUE FACTS.
"Kennedy deputized the Alabama National Guard to force Democratic Governor George Wallace to accept Black students at the University of Alabama.  It sometimes is very wise.   

So now you call conservatives racists?  The second most liberal president in the history of the country (after Wilson) Democrat President FDR was the one ""rounding up brown skinned people."" He impoverished and interned Japanese American citizens during WW2.   

You are consistently wrong but continue to post your unsubstantiated and hurtful opinions anyway.  
To be a liberal you do not have to be ignorant and misinformed but it sure makes it a lot easier."
"No Allan, they're not protesting the treatment of black Americans. 

Colin Kaepernick was protesting the treatment of African-Americans last year.  And none of those players was kneeling alongside Colin Kaepernick last year.   Those owners linking arms with their players and mouthing off are the very same owners that have boycotted Colin Kaepernick from the NFL -- the hypocrisy is overwhelming.

All these protests are about Trump's conduct.  And that's not worth disrespecting your country.  

Trump's behaviour is great. Trump's supporters knew what they were getting when they voted him in, and he's delivering.  Like I said, Trump's conduct is far better than the deceitful lies of Trudeau, Obama and Clinton."
"You are 100% correct. In japan there are no 3rd world Mexicans or negros and in England , Germany and Canada the people live as peasants in a multicultural cesspool."
Canada has a much smaller proportion of black folks than the US. Do you think that may be a reason for the greater civility?
And don't forget trashed the health care system and ruined many of our alliances.  But he was black so he's coo'!
"They censored nigger? You make a quote that blacks are not persecuted for saying n-1- g-g-e-r and it is overwritten? I  had black a UO basketball players say to me, ""what up my nigger"", as he came off the court for half time. It just struck me as funny and definitely not racist or worthy of uproar."
"Maybe the writer could focus on being a human being instead of using black as an excuse . It is getting harder to even talk to black people because of their hostile demeanor, like everyone is out to get them . The opposite seems to be the fact black people get more favourable treatment because of their colour. Just look at Trudeaus civil service ,dark people first ,white people last."
"""These blacks""?  ""The black way""?  Wow, just wow.  That is a very racist post and I completely disagree with Meredith crying racism as being a sexual predator has nothing to do with skin colour.  Leave the trailer park."
Is Multichoice 'black controlled'.... I know the CEO is black but I thought it was part of News24 stable... Koos Bekker and his successors!
He's not from the inner city. He comes from an upper middle class family. Why would you mention inner city? Because he's black?
"Fine, as I am prepared to respond regarding why she lost her party's nomination to the first black president. That's it. Read it. She lost to the first black president. So we were looking to have either the first woman or first black president but not both and not both at the same time. Obama is and was awesome. So she had competition. You and your ilk make it sound like she lost to Mickey Mouse. Mike Tyson lost a couple of professional fights. Are you suggesting that because he lost he sucks and you could have beat him? There is no shame in losing to Obama. And there's no shame in losing to Trump, when one considers that most people are simpletons and he got the simpleton vote."
"Today's GOP is little more than a white identity death cult. They are motivated by fear, hate, and resentment. During the Obama administration they made it very clear that they don't want a multicultural multi-ethnic America and equal rights for all. They miss the good old days when lynching black folks was family entertainment for white people. They miss the days when white men could get away with murdering black people while they prayed in church. They welcome endorsements from Klansmen and neo-nazis.  Not all Republicans are racists and bigots. How ever they are all willing to share the GOP with them. They have no desire for a merit based society.  Mere equality is a demotion for them."
"The problem - racism- is that it is not solely ""owned"" by whites.  If it was only ever exhibited by whites then you might not have as many people disagreeing.  Racism exists in every culture, in cities, in religion, in every country. 

I have friends from Africa that came here to the USA and tell me over and over the only REAL racism they experience is from their ""cousins"" (their word) American Blacks. That they are not remotely treated as poorly by whites, as they are by blacks -- REGARDLESS of what city in the US they have lived in. Several of my friends from Africa said that they would much rather live in a white neighborhood than a black neighborhood, One told me that while living in the black neighborhoods he and his 4 children were constantly called ""stupid africans"" But in white neighborhoods this has never happened to them."
"Black people are segregated because they move into the same neighbourhoods all the time and dissuade other races from moving in. When the Liberals opened a floodgate of Africans into Toronto ,whole neighbourhoods of whites ,minorities and businesses were driven out of their own neighbourhoods . Now Africans are demanding their own African schools . They need to look in the mirror ."
"These people who should be ashamed but are not--they do not value either ethics or democratic process--hence their colluding candidate and ""president."" They want their cake and to eat it too. 
Republicans want democracy for themselves but want to deny it to others--Blacks, women, gays, lesbians and transgender people, Latinos, immigrants. It's like democracy in ancient Greece only instead of democracy being limited to male citizens, it's limited to citizens who are white. This is the ""vision"" of the Republicans--a society where rights are offered--but only to whites who are straight. America will fall behind more enlightened societies because it allows its most backward elements to lead."
"rich, thats the most ridiculous post ive ever seen.

frank, its been 400 years frank and white people still think blacks aren't as good as they are and show, and legalize it is subtle ways. you had a leg up at birth but sound to arrogant, or ignorant, to admit it. greed is making insurance companies drop out, not the aca."
"The Leftist narrative of President Trump somehow being a white nationalist will go down as being tantamount to GOP narratives of Obama being born in Kenya.  The KKK has been in that area for decades, and was started by the Democrats.  I'm still trying to find the footage of Obama explicitly denouncing the actions of Antifa and BLM.  I see him speaking after their violence, but do not see him explicitly denounce them-- does that make him a black nationalist?   President Trump once again beats the Leftist media narrative that he is somehow in favor of white supremacy, and says that the hatred from all sides- the KKK, BLM, Antifa- needs to stop.  He's totally correct."
"""Sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed.""

"Don't get mad at the cops. Get made at the millions of other black guys who have committed   an endless stream of mindless and violent crimes against persons , property, and society. Black guys have an 80 times greater risk of being shot by other black guys than by cops, But cops have to clean up the blood. They see it every day and their own experience forewarn them of what to expect and who they are at greatest risk from. Your son is collateral damage in the collapse of black urban culture. Despite being 15% of the population (yup that's all) even you must grasp how much of society's problems stem from fatherless black kids running wild."
"Will he demand reparations for   black drug dealers who wind up in prison, torn from the bosom of their loved ones, families and homes? Perhaps an inquiry into murdered and missing black drug dealers?"
"It's a word that seems to set progressives off, in that they condemn the police, while the statistics disprove BLM's contentions.

Meanwhile, the rate of murder in black communities is sky high.    I know progressives like yourself don't want to hear that, but some of us think that BLM is a foolish distraction from the tragedy of black on black crime."
How many times has that flag been flown over a lynched black man?
"My advise to black South Africans is to be very careful. The white South Africans will use every trick in the book to undermine your governments and your leaders. They want power back, although they still control majority of the wealth of your nation."
"Other than being black and having plastic coverings, what is your definition of an ""assault weapon""."
"Palatable, of course violence is bad. But one side is advocating the purging of Jews, blacks, minorities and immigrants from America. The other side is against this. They are not the same regardless of who punched who first. Don't fall for the ""violence is the issue."" White supremacists and Nazis here, in America, are the issue."
"I'd suggest that a white person smearing black makeup on her/his face in order to impersonate a black person is already doing something, however unintentional, that is demeaning to black people. The white person's ignorance of his/her culture's white supremacist tradition of caricature and cultural appropriation does not change the fact of her/his participation in this tradition."
"what is the alternative?  repubs, you know exactly what happened at the national level, and our repubs favor and hail this moron for president.  if one cannot recognize that a person is so inept and unsuited, and blindly support him, then it shows that the local repubs are also inept.  two us senators had the guts to tell it like it is about trump, yet the other repubs  in congress are scared to say anything even though many of them are thinking the same things as these two senators.  you think you had it bad with the dems, but you don't realized how bad the repubs are, which is reflected now at the national level.  bush 43 gave us one of the worst recession in years, he fought a stupid and winless war, Obama tried to straighten things out but most of his presidency was fighting the repubs majority in congress who fought him because he is black.  now this white supremacist is trying to undo everything, causing chaos in the country and abroad.  nope, repubs are not the answer."
"Exactly right. And with being the first female president preceded by the first black president; not being female or black being the crime, but both being totally inept for the job by being voted ""first"", we will be nailing the final nails in our country's cofffin. But at least wavemaker will be able to print something super intelligent like ""Haha!"" at the end of her utterly incoherent comments."
"Yeah, where is BLM when these types of attacks occur?  Here's the answer: There's zero political gain to be had when it's black on black or black on white.  To summarize, black lives only matter when whitey can be demonized and progressives can pat themselves on the back for appearing compassionate."
"What else is there to say than ""black lives matter""?"

"We have forced registration?
Actually, landed white men mostly were poorly educated. Women were excluded from federal elections, was that owing to your expressed ""lack of wisdom""? Wikipedia says that landed women and free blacks could vote in local election in some states. Only 2-3% of citizens voted for the president in the fist couple of elections."
"98% of those stories are hoaxes perpetrated by crazy social justice warriors. The Website ""Moonbattery"" has listed EVERY ONE OF THEM under their ""Hate Hoax List,"" so stop lying, DB. Anyway, how many White people have been murdered and raped in the last 20 years by feral blacks? 10,000 times more than blacks having the n-word
painted on their door. Utter BS"
"Not all Republicans are racists. However, they are all collaborators with racists. They are like the ""good Germans"" that never asked, where did the Jews disappear to? Today, they never question why cops kill so many unarmed black  people, including children."
It also smacks of racism. It paints a picture of  a black man Needing an escort to safely navigate the area and ensure his safety from all of those kids. Ridiculous.
"Tabatha, instead write a column about your opinion of the MSM' responsibility for supporting intolerance towards Trump and his supporters, that has lead to a series of hate crimes, most notably the one committed by four black people in Chicago against a disabled white man.  Ah, and notice that times are a'changing. ;)"
So are black masked  violent afascist  Bolsheviks running  the streets while police stand down our new politically correct  heroes were supposed to worship from now on?
"It's not my ""logic""...it's historical FACT.  First black, COURT ORDERED, in 1655, as a slave was John Casor who had left the indenture of Anthony Johnson and going to work for a neighbor telling him his indenture had ended.  The Court, after finding for the neighbor, reversed itself, and awarded Casor to life as a slave to Johnson.  Johnson, himself, was a black Angolan who had been captured by a neighboring tribe, sold to Arab slave traders and ended up in Virginia.  After gaining HIS freedom, he became rather well to do, and have several ""indentured"" individuals working his farm.  but Casor was the 1st black ""slave"" documented by court action.  So, Johnson, a black former ""indentured"" individual took possession of John Casor for life, another black, as a slave.  Why is it I know more about your history than do you?  Perhaps you really DO need to do some research, other than the liberal brainwashing you have been subjected to!  You denegrate the accomplishments of your own people. Sad"
"WOW when liberal democrats have their faces shoved in the mud they come up sputtering, incoherent and full of bogus reasons why it happened! Of course you missed the FACT that Trump is about to be our new President because of the turnout in his favor by Blacks, Women and minorities - the highest for any Republican since Reagan..

After 8 years of a clown - ANYTHING that Trump is able to accomplish will be better than the past 8 years have given us.. Grow up, realize that YOU lost and embrace the chance for real change, not the continued corruption that Democrats seem to thrive on..."
"No, BLM protests when a cop kills a black.

"The Southern Baptist Convention, which had black preachers even before the US Revolution, might be astounded to discover that they foster segregation.  But there are only 15.29 million of them; how many of them have you 'met'?

It is ""the largest Protestant body in the United States, with over 15 million members as of 2015. This also makes it the second-largest Christian body in the United States, after the Catholic Church.  Must be all those Catholics that are racists., Huh?  All 68 million of them in the US?  

Your narrow, bigoted (and racist) viewpoint has to ignore at least 150 million Christians to justify itself.

"Here we go again with the false narrative of the left re: white cops killing black people. There are far more white people killed by cops than blacks killed by cops. If we really want to be serious about the problem of blacks being killed why is there no mention of the black-on-black killings daily in Chicago? We don't hear about it because it doesn't fit the left's narrative.

I'm sick of hearing the BLM mantra. Black lives are no more important than any other lives, so quit using a phrase the left designed around a false narrative.

This poor, young black man has bought into the lies that are determined to create chaos and widen the racial divide. Nothing positive will come of it."
"What does race have to do with the abortion issue, or better yet the election between two white candidates?   Make America White again??????  Are you serious.  What about the black and Hispanic voters who did not vote for Clinton, what was their excuse?"
"Trump is a white supremacist. When he was dealing in real estate in New York he was busted numerous times for refusing to rent to blacks.  His father, Fred Trump was photographed at KKK rallies and was an ardent white supremacist.  If you can't stand looking at the truth about Trump, consider voting for someone else."

"Ah, a Trump supporter. He seems to have a lot of those among South African whites, but I can't work out why. The new world order according to Steve Bannon will not benefit us in any way. In fact, it will make it much, much worse. Remember that you are a citizen of a black African country. Trump is not bothered about your lot. He will react to the South African government. He will not save Christianity from Islam or Satan or any other threat either. His constituency voted for ""America First"", not white people or Christians first. 

The man is at best a narcissist, at worst a lying psychopath, who has no concept of how to govern Upington, let alone the most powerful country in the world. And he has this stupid idea that you can govern through twitter. He just can't stop campaigning! Yes, he and his aides were probably stupid enough to consort with the Russians. They have so little knowledge of international affairs and the law, that they probably did not even realise it was wrong."
"1 - It's in the article.
2 - Define ""many"". A majority of black voters still favour Democrats.
3 - I didn't know there was a ""Liberal"" party in the US of any significance. And it's pretty ironic of you to post this claim while providing no evidence yourself.
4 - Evidence?
5 - Are you suggesting that should be enough to keep these ""uppity blacks"" satisfied?"

"So what is your plan to prevent blacks from being arrested for any other other crime, are you going to legalize all other crimes? Your evidence of statistics does not excuse your comment or view. How about saying something like, fifty years from now people will look back on these dark ages like we do now over prohibition, which is entirely more accurate to the event. We are a nation of laws (or we used to be) it is what has separated us from banana republics that we are currently becoming. People choose to either follow laws that our legislative branch authors in the form of a bill and our executive branch signs into law or not, the choice is theirs. If you can not do the time do not do the crime and if you do not agree with the law work to change it.

Oh and I did not sourly express anything, please change your bong water and take a big hit for me. I also support the legalization of this marvelous and powerful plant, I just do not agree with you and your ignorant comparisons. :)"
"I had to move to California for an education that is not available at UAA. No way that I want to go to a college that is building new bullshit buildings and $110 million sports arenas while cutting the only reason we go to school, to get an education! I love the teachers there, but forget paying for some stupid sports and buildings, thinking that this will make people want to move to Alaska for college. Nobody moves to Alaska because one of the pros is that we have a new freaking arena. A great education in my interested field of study is why I would move for school. Not to mention the basketball coach obviously doesn't like black people and everyone knows it. These people who make financial decisions should get schooled by us because this is ridiculous. Do sports make a profit? Does our new arena make a profit? How many kids moved to Alaska to attend UAA because we have sports teams and a new arena? Are academic departments more important than a  week D2 Sport? You tell me. Jared out"
"If there's ""anti-Muslim hate"", is it really that some Canadians, out of all the dozens of ""tribes"" to come to Canada over the decades, just randomly and for no particular reason picked Muslims to dislike?  Or maybe some Muslims need to look in the mirror, and realize it might be because women are second class citizens in all Muslim societies (I do ""hate"" that), or maybe it's that some Muslims have proclaimed they hate the West and are inflicting terror to bring it down, or maybe because Muslims make it clear that Islam is first and Canada and all else is second, or maybe because the ""good"" Muslims don't march en masse when the ""bad"" ones kill infidels, or maybe it's because seeing a woman dressed head to toe in a black veil in public sends a bit of a chill through a modern woman, or maybe we'd like to see more integration efforts and less accommodation demands, or maybe just because when my I knock on my Muslim neighbour's door it opens just a crack and all I see is a covered face."
"There were 2800 black people confirmed lynched in the first 50 years of the 20th century, which is 1/8th of how many blacks lynched black criminals for outrageous crimes in the first five years after apartheid ended in South Africa. The FBI now attributes almost 80,000 whites that have died at the hands of blacks since 1965 when those whites passed the ""Civil Rights Act"" and got that for their trouble. Over a million white women raped. Many of these crimes so horrific the details have to be hidden from public record. A woman packraped for three days and then killed by pouring lye down her throat. That's just one example of 80,000 deaths. Technically, black people are one of the leading causes of death in the United States for all races combined. Black people and truth don't mix - they have another narrative and reality is not in agreement with their story."
Had a white entertainer stood over the body of a black man with an Obama toe-tag the outrage would be epic and prolonged.  This double standard is destructive to our society.
"Yes, where was he when Black Lives matter was marching in the streets and screaming ""cops are pigs, fry them like bacon"", (or something like that). I heard crickets from the former President. How about the riots at Berkeley , when they rioted to protest a conservative speaker (to prevent her from speaking). Media was fine with that, and where was the former President? It seems like protests by one group seem to be ""OK"" (freedom of speech), while a conservative is not allowed to even speak. Are you ok with that?"
"You seem to be 100% in favor about quite a lot of extreme views.

I'm about 70% unhappy about the flag part of the protest and about 90% in favor of objecting to the routine, unaccountable murder of young black men. 

(I'm only about 15% upset about ""black on black"" violence, 60% angry at the NRA's gun-running into urban areas, and about 99% tired of the biggest traitor in American history lecturing anyone about patriotism.)"
"Trump is a racist sympathizer.

 He single-handedly used his wealth and fame to perpetuate the lie – wholly racist in nature – that President Obama was not born in the United States.

He has declared his intention to deport millions of law-abiding Muslims, ban immigration of Muslims, and has called Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists.

 He openly accepted the support of avowed white supremacists during his campaign and has done virtually nothing to distance himself from these groups and their political aims since.

The neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups that marched in Charlottesville are similarly transparent in their purpose. 

They believe in the supremacy of white European Christians over, well, everyone else. 

In particular, they want to eliminate Jews and Blacks, and Latinos, Muslims, LGBTQ folks, feminists (perhaps women, generally), Catholics, and many others. 

There is no mystery here."
"Oh yeah, the elusive legacy, bit late for that, your times  up, two terms, that's it. Instead of hanging around and being a nuisance, go down to your old home town and work on the unbelievable murder rate amongst young black men. Try your vaunted oratory skills there."
"The following comments were posted by white Anchorage residents when 17 year-old Alexandra Ellis ran over Jeff Dusenbury and left him to die, and was sentenced to a year in jail.  No names, just the comments and the dates:

“I'm sure this girl is no monster…”—08/08/14

“How perfect were you when you were 17?”—08/09/14

“We ought to wait for all the evidence before hanging a 17 year old.”—08/09/14

"I'm a Christian and I understand that there are other religious holidays or agnostic or atheist beliefs in December.  It is inclusive to say; ""Happy Holidays"" or ""Have a great winter break!"" Instead of assuming ""Merry Christmas"" speaks to all.  Donning a black face is insensitive and stupid.  I am, however, protective of a person's right to be racist and wear whatever offensive costume he or she wants at a private party.  Shame on her, but she is allowed.

"Black cop shoots black suspect and blacks riot. What does that indicate? Why don't whites riot when cops shoot white people?

 680 people – 161 of them black men –  have been shot and killed by police officers this year, according to a Washington Post database tracking police shootings.""

"Something I admire about the Jews is how quick is the respond to bigotry ad emerging fascism. Some of them were also active against the apartheid government, both as activists within the ANC and other organisations such as Black Sash as well as assisting black students with bursaries to access tertiary education...and I a not referring to prominent ones like Joe Slovo, Ronnie Kasrils etc. I a referring to ordinary Jews who never made news. It is important to again hear those voices rising again, not only because of idiots like Mgxitama, but aso the geeral rot in our society."
"This is the dumbest thing i have read from Dale in a long time.  If you won a million dollars, how would that be different than winning a million dollars.  The guy felt he was being stopped because he was black, coincidence he was black.  If he hadn't of been stopped and beaned somebody in the head with the stick, you would be crying about cops not doing their jobs.  It must be great to place yourself on the winning side of a debate no matter what, Dale."
"It's ignorant to assert that it's black and white. You obviously have never been in this situation. It wouldn't be possible unless America were a female-supremacist culture. Then you would know about gray, and black and blue. But you're just a talker who speaks banalities. And you're common. Seriously, how many American men are misogynists? American culture is misogynist and  More women that vote Democrat and carry firearms and/or employ lawyers could be the people that change things because women definitely aren't tolerating people who assert that women aren't entitled to privacy, to control their genitals, aren't entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We will have justice in these matters or we will sabotage this woman-hating society. We will tear this society apart."
"Question:  Do you support the French law that now prohibits the freedom of choice in clothing?  Or, are you just explaining why some people are upset with Muslims in general?

I had a conservative friend 'give in' to gay marriage in Iowa, as long ""as they don't hold hands or kiss where I have might see them""
For years our black population was kept out of certain area's of the South, I myself remember the 'whites only' signs in Houston in the 1950's.   Few people murdered Black citizens, but segregation was to keep them out of sight of White activities.   It's called institutionalized bigotry.   

Are you agreeing with the French ruling or not?  

p.s.  I find Muslim's treatment of women despicable in many  cultures.   It certainly doesn't fit modern American standards.  

While women living in ISIS territory don't have a choice, a woman living in America or France should be protected by civil law to make her own decisions, including traditional Muslim clothing."
"hmmm, we do have plenty of example of armed black men in public.    It also clear the market for guns in some black urban communities are thriving and purchases made with little problem or objection.

We don't know each other, but do you think the black community would support tighter gun control or not?   I've heard a lot of white folks on the topic, almost no black input - which is a big problem considered the level of violence in Some primarily black urban commuties."

"Are you serious?
Read the headline and the story. 
Did you notice what the story was about? It was about a black guy hugging an alleged Nazi.
BOOM that is the story. It was nentioned that the man was punched in the face. It was noted in every story. 
It it were just some Nazi getting punched, it might not have made such news. 

See how that works? It is called journalism. 
Would you prefer the headline said, “A good person was punched in the face outside a Richard Spencer speech by a stupid person”?

Rememebr when we killed Nazis and that was a good thing? 
Are you trying to excuse White Nationalism? It is your choice, this is America."
"This country has been a giant affirmative action program for people that Europe didn't need or want. If white folks are such hard working individuals, why did they need black slaves? I guess white folks don't have much of a work ethic for the business model the nation was built on. You are free to be a snow flake if that makes you feel better. You don't even know what you have earned and what you were given for just showing up white."
"Remarkably ignorant and racist.  My family is white, black, and yellow, so I know from daily experience that intelligent people of all races can be proud of supporting this President.  Did you consider that many patriots are actually at work?"
"Yes, it's impossible to mention north Portland without invoking deep history. 

And it's easy to assume that every commentor on a ""black story"" is a racist jerk. I'll admit to being a jerk on my best days, but I've mostly worked through the former, and try to be a better parent in that respect than mine were. 

Charter schools are always a difficult situation. On one extreme you have corporations looking to turn a profit, and religions and idealogues looking to undermine public education. On the other extreme we have parents just looking for a better solution to their child's education. Long-term, those two agendas are often diametrically opposed to each other. Short-term, maybe not so much. My point is that turning over public facilities to charter schools is a slippery slope... in the long term."
"Colin Kaepernick Signed a $114,000,000/ 6 year contract with the 49ers. PROOF that blacks are not oppressed. Colin Kaepernick should be ashamed of himself. Wrong message to send.

Dont sit around crying about how the ""man"" is holding you back. If you sit around and smoke weed and act like a moron towards police...well....you reap what you sow !"
"I'm not sure if you noticed or not, Mr. Dalton, but the two previous elections to this last one, that ""white racist nation"" elected an African-American as President.

"If you don't like it here go back to Africa or wherever you came, or were taken from.  My ancestors in Eastern Europe were also slaves but instead of whining about it every day as an excuse for my laziness and n0t paying attention in school I have moved on.  I am in control of my life - not the past.  Time for people to grow up and live in the present.  BTW, blacks in the US have it far better than blacks in an black run country in Africa."
"Don't forget affirmative action.... aka ""black privilege""."
"I agree with you the white lefties globalists are the most hypocritical humans of them all. They are the cancer of the white race Being racist doesn't mean to be cruel to other races.When a black woman told me that with 10% whites left on earth in 2016 ,there were 9% too many.Now  that is not racism ,but cruelty."
Trump: The only good vote is the white only vote. Black and Hispanic votes mean voter fraud. That's American.
"So, by your ""logic,"" the failure of the black community to call out the thugs in their midst makes them complicit to all of the violence committed by some of their members.

Same same, right?"

"Wavemaker again tries to write/speak in complete sentences. As long as she can say ""racism"" or ""bigot"" or ""white"" in a series of paragraphs she has the ability to pat herself on the back with her extremely long arm. As long as people like her continue to avoid the FACT that the people they are defending (???) are committing crimes disproportionate to their demographics, they are going to be killed disproportionately. Figure it out wavemaker. Do your math. You are a true fool if you believe cops, and especially white cops, are in some sort of conspiracy to kill black folks. Here's a crazy idea for the bleeding hearts; do EXACTLY as the police say, when they say it. You will live longer. I can tell you from first hand experience, 18 times to be exact. I might be/have been a POS. But I'm still alive."
"Good point.

Also, prior to false columns like this one, there always seemed to be an implicit taboo about pointing out how 
black males make up less than 7% of the US population, but black males commit over 60% of the violent felonies in the US.

When crime statistics are examined black males always commit the most crime in the categories such as:

Murder

Rape

Burglary

Assault.

With respect to shootings and other violent crimes, the greatest problem clearly is black males, not white males."
"You knock that straw man with all your might Mr. Haase. All those will a ""collage"" education will be moved by your ""spilled blood"" metaphors which are not at all threadbare. 
It obviously really bothers you that African-Americans have benefited from their talents enabling them to access higher education and be paid the market value for their risking  permanent head injuries so people can be entertained. 
You only speak though for veterans who believe the tales made up by the pussy-grabber-in-chief regarding how to interpret football players who choose to kneel in protest of white supremacy, white nationalism and a judicial system that is demonstrably racist. 
You do not speak for all white people either. 
The last line of your letter is pure drivel. The only person who says soldiers in coffins are a silly matter is you--in your letter above."
"No, you don't. I've been to dozens of peaceful protests, and no one EVER brought weapons or shields. I'll bet you've never been part of a peaceful protest in your miserable life. The videos don't lie: the Nazis attacked counter-protesters, they beat an unarmed black man with metal rods, they poured kerosene on a person in a wheelchair and tried to light it on fire, they attacked unarmed, uninvolved students on the UVA campus with their ridiculous tiki torches. They threw urine on journalists. They threatened unarmed church leaders and worshipers, barricading them inside a church. They terrorized the innocent, unarmed, law-abiding residents of Charlottesville. They antagonized and threatened black residents of a housing project. Even their ""invitations"" to the event encouraged violence. You don't even know what you're talking about."
"Bless his heart, he is as crazy as a bedbug. However, once you start punching innocent people in the eye causing them to be hospitalized for the crime of being black and walking past him, then you need to be punished. Deplorable behavior, on the uptick once trump was elected, will be stopped and addressed every single time by the civilized people."
"“Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,” Trump said in a statement to reporters at the White House.

I still remember that black woman shimmied up the flag pole in front of the South Carolina State Legislature, who then took down the confederate flag.  I was overcome with hope for all humanity."
Those events exist. Look at 'black bike week' in Myrtle Beach and all the gay cruises. There is absolutely a double standard. Just try setting up a whites only 'Ivory Awards' to the corresponding blacks only 'Ebony Awards' and see how that would fly.

"I know I am about to make a comment on the problem that is going to make all the REAL racists to go nuclear.  Here it is:  The wage gap is the fault of the black men.  For these 4 reasons:  1) they pursue degrees that aren't worth as much  2)  They have a higher incarnation rate 3) they are 40 times more likely to commit a violent crime and 4) they have a sense of entitlement that isn't earned.      People would like to add ""discrimination"" but think about that.  Hasn't the criminal behavior and violent tendencies enough to make an employer shy?  So..... WWYD?  I never hesitated to hire anyone when I ran a business and didn't see any who worked for me behave poorly, very few blacks applied but they were accepted and worked well.  But the figure I used came from the DOJ.  Not my personal experience."
"What if young black men DO murder each other at astounding rates? Does that somehow excuse police killings of them? 

The fact that you are even implying that it does suggests that black lives don't matter to a lot of white people, including many on these boards."

"Just blame it on a black guy.

A white security officer told police he was shot by a black man.
Within minutes, 55 officers swarmed the campus, along with four police dogs and a State Patrol aircraft to search for the suspect.
Ahlers, the 'victim', was taken to the hospital and released. He is expected to make a full recovery.
At a news conference, police spokesman Mike Ernster said the campus had been on lockdown with “1,800 student held captive in their dorm rooms.”
Neighborhood residents, shaken by reports of a gunman at large, asked police officers to check their houses.
Turns out, he’d shot himself."
"Yes ............. Trump took credit for the 2% increase in the S&P 500

"Kaepernick's original protest was intended to call attention to the disparity of treatment between blacks and whites by police, and that's all well and good. But make no mistake... what happened this weekend had nothing to do with that purpose... it was 200, or so, NFL players sticking a big old middle finger in Donald Trump's face... well deserved, IMHO.

Fifty years ago, I took an oath to defend people's right to protest. I repeated that oath no less than seven more times during the course of my service, and that oath has no expiration date. But I also reserve my own rights to disagree with the manner in which a protest is undertaken, and the one that started all of this in the first place is just plain stupid. The whole purpose of any protest is to encourage others to take up your cause. I can only speak for myself, but if you want to bring me over to your cause, the absolute worst thing you could do is to disrespect those things I hold dear."
"Could it be that black service folks proportionally commit more criminal offenses than others?  Nah, could never happen."
You are still writing about Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton?  I thought you were going to come up with new black folks to whine about.  No black friends?
"The tired old ""racism"" charge is getting a played out and isn't working anymore...the left really needs to work on its creativity. 

Don't forget which party used the Klan as its militant wing to keep blacks from participating in elections (Democrats). Let's also not forget who called the late Senator (and Grand Wizard of the K K K) Robert Byrd a ""friend and mentor"". That would be Hillary. Not Trump. But let's not let reality get in the way of you recycled talking points that you borrowed from some leftist cable news channel no one watches"
Diversity does not mean communist. If diversity means hiring all black dudes to play basketball so be it. That is diverse. We don't have to force short white fat women to be basket players or hiphop singers...
"People decided to tune out because they are so offended by the idea that black lives do indeed matter? America: where some white people value an inanimate flag more than the lives of their fellow citizens who have black skin.

Shannon Sharpe nailed it. We'll see how many people who value the American flag above all boycott the NFL for employing Williams Jr, a traitorous Confederate flag waiver."
"Faber's writing ""Thank God white people populated America and not the blacks,"" is not like someone using the perfectly good word ""niggardly"" - not even a little bit. One is a racist comment; the other merely sounds like it, but isn't."
"When Trump won over your slave owner Clinton, you know full well that if you attack Trump you would find yourselves getting investigated, but you were sure you could get away with it because you use the race card, but that is failing too.

How long do you think it will take for the black people find out your supporting slavery by protecting the Slave Masters the Democrats for your own gain?  I will make this Viral as fast as I can. Democrats refused to vote to abolish Slavery, and you are with them because to think the low income blacks are desperate enough to get paid to riot and convince the rest that Democrats will take care of them.

"It pleases me to no end to see the settlers finally being held accountable for their words and actions.  We have gotten used to having our way because of white privilege, so it helps to see that -rather than hiding behind white privilege and the usual exhortations for the dark-skinned to ""get over it, we're just joking"", these settlers are held to account.  So far, many of us are in agreement that all these claims about ""free speech"" is really a lent Arion that white settlers can't make fun of the dark-skinned like in ""the good 'ol days""."
"Vuso,
Your statement that in the past agricultural output was for the white community only and export is as ridiculous as it is wrong.

Have you ever done a real job and worked in business - ie produced a service or product that a customer is prepared to pay for?

Let's just picture the white farmer with his crop that he has just harvested and will go vrot within 7 days (agricultural products are called ""perishables"" - google it.)

""OK, I have just sold my best produce in the export market - now to get rid of the rest.

You 100 black customers can take a hike - I am not prepared to sell my goods to you.

Hey white boy - come buy some oranges and grapes from me"".

Do you actually believe the garbage that you spout, or are you just a hired hand?"
53% of young whites say he is legitimate these are true American citizens less percentage in blacks the Latinos most all are non citizens here illegally so the majority of young support trump as a legitimate president.

"Allowing a business to use Religion as an excuse not to serve someone is the ultimate slippery slope to allowing a business owner to discriminate against anyone, for nearly any reason.  How is refusing to serve a gay couple now any different than the racists that refused to serve blacks or mixed raced marriages back in the 40's and 50's?  The answer - its not.  Its discrimination painted with a different brush and people are using the Bible as their shield.

And to be clear - no one in this case was forcing this baker to do anything different than what he already did for hundreds/thousands of customers before.  No one asked him to cater the wedding or write something on the cake that he found offensive.  It was simply the fact that a cake he was making was going to be used in a gay wedding.  Thats it.  So, based on that standard, could the owner of Hobby Lobby come out and say they no longer will sell any of their products to anyone who has had an abortion?  How is that any different?"

"Mike Dunham's request that we ""give black soldiers their due"" is a ridiculous one, at best.  This is not a new story: as other posters have stated, the role of black soldiers' contributions has already been reported in other publications.  Dunham claims ""their role was severely downplayed,"" yet never once states how.

Are black soldiers the only ones who ""suffered mightily from severe cold, clouds of mosquitoes, ice, muck, lousy equipment and poor supplies?""  It should be noted that this characterized the life of EVERYone who contributed to the Alaska Highway.  Why not honor and recognize the Army Corps of Engineers- all of them?

Wouldn't Alaskans stand to benefit from learning about ALL the varied groups who has contributed to this great stretch of road?  Presentation ceremonies and park benches to only a select group is exactly the type of micro-Cultural appropriation that has will continue to divide this country- we need to identify these demands for what they are- and stop them."
Wolf Eagle is only against Carson and says bad things because Carson is black. Its so obvious.
Just another example of the media elites  totally in the bag for Hillary. And if Trump DIDNT reach out to blacks they would nail him for that too! Consummate hypocrites.. CNN viewership now lower then the Food Network? Keep it up guys. You've destroyed any scintilla of objective neutrality left in journalism and instead transformed it into your personal propaganda machine. Reminds one of Hitlers propaganda efforts. Hillary may well be as corrupt. Efforts to use regulations and the judiciary  to silence Fox and conservative talk radio also remind us of another time. Many on the left would sack them if given a chance with Obamas DOJ to follow with a hand slap. College campuses crush free speech and shout down conservatives.  Planned Parenthood can openly boast of mutilating and selling baby parts and its all about the evil intentions of the people posing as potential buyers. Hilary's endless lies go on and on with almost daily revelations yet you coddle her.
"Oh I'm not surprised. When I was 19 years old, I spent 3 months in a homeless shelter. I had a group of weird Latina and black women look at me like I was garbage. Later on after they came to know me and like me, they apologized for thinking I ""looked like a Nazi"" when they first saw me. 

How did I ""look like a Nazi""? Because a lot of people know someone of ethnic German background when they see them."
"But it's more than the fact that they led a rebellion.  That rebellion was based on the concept that one portion of humanity is inferior to others, based on the color of their skin.  And the statutes were put up to honor that concept.  They were erected in places where the popular opinion of those in power was that ""Blacks had to be put in their place"" and kept there.  I just can't comprehend how anyone who claims to be a person of good will, let alone a Christian, could be in favor of retaining these statues to honor the proposition that white people are superior to blacks."
"Don't be silly.  The groups sponsoring the demonstration, AND the bulk of those participating in it were white supremacy/white nationalist whose message is one of racism.  BTW: this is NOT Israel.....my outrage is over overt, ""in your face"" racism right here in the United States.  Distracting the conversation to focus on marriage laws in Israel is a rather weak attempt to excuse the increasing racism in our country.  The ""gay pride"" movement was focused on convincing gays to ""come out of the closet"" and cease to accept second class citizenship because of their sexual orientation.  ""Black Pride, IMO, focuses on the many significant contributions African Americans have made over our history and continue to make......again, a rejection of second class citizenship. It's really rather shameful to equate the white supremacy/white nationalist movements with the minority movements to step forward to full rights and pride of citizenship.  Gary Crum"

"The feds had to get involved in order to legalize mixed race marriages - it wasn't until 1967 that the US Supreme Court struck down state laws outlawing mixed race marriages.

And it wasn't until 1968 that a case claiming religious justification for not serving blacks in a restaurant made it to the Supreme Court."
"What happens , happens and 100% of the blame can be placed at the foot of the democrats, the liberal press, unions, college professors, Clinton, McCain, Obama, Graham, FBI and CIA..   If these people bent on the destruction of America have their way, it will be destroyed because these people did not let Trump do his job.     This asinine support for Clinton,  Obama, Soros, the Russian diversion and all this black lives crap has caused the squandering of precious time, resources , and energy of the Trump administration but most of all it has weakened our stance on the world stage and decreased the ability of the military to do their job.       I think people have lost their minds with the stupid stunts being played out today by the media.     Who cares if some black fool gets on his knees during a football game; who cares if people riot and tear up their own town because a thug gets shot by the police;   who cares if some hollywood clown screws some actress!    Nobody with any sense!!"
"To those that state ""it is just a flag"" or ""just a piece of cloth"" at what point does an absolute symbol of hate, bigotry and pure evil become more than just a symbol?  If these morons from Weld county displayed a noose, would that be enough for you deniers; or is that just a piece of string?  How about if they drove through the parking lot dragging a caricature of a black person; is that just boys being boys?  Everyone (even the deniers) know exactly what that despicable flag represents.  Please read the book ""White Rage"", it tells an incredible story of the institutionalized racism that was and continues to exist since the inception of the U.S."
"Thats snowflake, thats a yuge chip on Pauls shoulder and he wants everyone to feel oppressed. He didn't approve of having a black president And now he and his ilk have a new N word to cling to, a new set of tired clichéd slogans to cheerlead.

"This response is so sick it should be funny. But it is actually prophetically scary.

You sound like a wealthy white southern plantation owner telling his black slaves that they should be happy with the fine life they were provided.  Do you think any of those slave holders wished on their death bed that they could have done the backbreaking work on the fields themselves?
"By ancestors of slaves in my comment above, I meant to type offspring. Of course most slaves also had slave ancestors, and most slaves had slave offspring. That is the nightmare of inter-generational slavery. At one point in history, I forget the date, it was estimated that a slave could look 7 generations back and find slave ancestors and with the benefit of a crystal ball, would be able to see 7 generations forward that would also be slaves. No other demographic in America or modern history has been subject to that unspeakable tyranny and inhumanity.

But it didn't end with slavery. Slaves also had ""free"" offspring and subsequent descendants who were subject to over a century and a half of anti-black discrimination, marginalization, exclusion, and terrorism. 

Enough celebration of white supremacy and tyranny. Let's stop erasing descendants of slaves to prop up descendants of white supremacists."

"Well you’re wrong and here’s why:
There is no recent history of white people being enslaved. So no white person is going to be offended. 
For the good professor to not realize that his remark, coming from a white person and directed to a black person, would be offensive, is evidence of privilege and racism."
"I can believe that blacks (particularly young black males) may be stopped more frequently by the police than other 'groups'. I've heard that often enough elsewhere. 

However I find it hard to believe people frequently make 'racist comments' in Toronto as I assume I would have witnessed some of this as I traveled around the city. And, quite frankly, I cannot recall a single instance where people directed racist comments at other people, including situations where someone got into an argument with someone else."
The legal ones hate the illegals more than anyone else since they are causing them problems by the behavior.  I know many Hispanics and also Blacks that are voting for Trump and actually encouraging others to do the same!  Maybe you can get a visitors pass to see Killary in her prison cell!
"Hey pot, its kettle, you're black.  PR went bankrupt for myriad reasons, not one as you claim.  Mostly they are strangled by federal regulations that help the mainland and don't give a thought to them.  things like the Jones act.  Not to mention that taxation without representation.

I wouldn't be surprised that if the feds continue to screw up the hurricane response, PR uses the incident to demand statehood."

""The minstrel show, or minstrelsy, was an American form of entertainment developed in the 19th century. Each show consisted of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music, performed by white people in make-up or blackface for the purpose of playing the role of black people.

"One thing I know for sure, Christianity doesn't prevent white racism. The most segregated time of the week in this country is Sunday morning. Heck, when black folks invite white folks to join them in prayer, they are risking their lives. White folks are still producing people like Dylan Roof in the 21st century. I can't think of any time when black folks murdered white folks while they prayed in church, to make a political statement about race. I do remember several times white folks murdered black folks while they prayed in church during my lifetime."
Problem is that I don't believe anything the Fraser Institute says.  If they thought there was a buck in it they would tell you black is white.

There's behaviors that I disapprove of that are accepted by those in poverty and parts of black culture that make me really uncomfortable.  We hate the promiscuity and unwanted children, but sex can be a moment of fun and pleasure for both people and it's free!  (at least in the short term).   Same in poor white rural Iowa/Oregon.  

Poverty does not give a crap about your skin color, but your skin color can add to the difficulty of being poor."
"The police are a funny issue with American conservatives. One minute, police are tools of the Federal Gubmint, cummin' fer the gunz... then they execute an unarmed black man and the same conservatives are defending the police and calling them heroes."
"Really, you felt it necessary to add race conflict into this?     Black guys can 'pop a couple of caps' at people, so you get to shoot at people too?         

Take a deep breath Motley.     We're talking criminal vandalism here, but that's not generally a death penalty.     Besides I count on thinking that there are responsible gun owners, like Motley, then you go and suggest shooting would be OK for a punctured tire?    Under pressure, is that what we should expect from most gun owners? 

It's a great illustration of the risk of gun ownership, a single incident of anger, or depression, can cost a life if you have access to a lethel weapon.  I'm not saying that disqualifies people from ownership, just a statement of fact about the risk of owning a gun.    If it helps, I tell a similar story to people looking to own a pitbull - that you are making a choice that involves a very real risk."
"I'm puzzled by your parting shot. I'm a straightforward person who says what I mean. I know what passive aggression is and I avoid it, as you probably do to. You're right, ""preordained"" was a guess but considering the armaments I would call it a reasonable guess. Let me be clear, in my opinion those bigots were and are looking for trouble, and they found it.

It's time for Jim Crow to die. Our nation is crippled with 13.5% of our population blocked from participation in the big game, making it to the middle class. Black people are as smart as white people, and they are certainly as nice to be around. These white NAZIs are against equality for all people. They can say so 'til the cows come home, but when they put together a marching army to spread their filth while bearing lethal arms, they should expect a push back. Lucky none of their sorry behinds got shot. I would have got in their ugly faces as well. 

We don't have room in our country for that much hate anymore."
"Let's be really clear, here:  these monuments are monuments to Jim Crow, the period in which they were erected, with the message of subjugation to Blacks.

Do you really think that message should be perpetuated in front of courthouses in the United States?  Because that's what the fascists are fighting for."
"Yes, racism is in the hearts of these leftist groups.  Their target is what they call 'white cis men'.  They want to kill all of them.  BLM is a mockery of the black civil rights movement.  BLM is nothing but pure hatred of 'white cis men'.  The media seems to like these racist groups because it fits their agenda, destroying western civilization.  These groups, make no mistake about it, are pure communist.  Talk to anyone from eastern Europe, the early stages of a communist take-over look exactly like this.  They begin to rile up the bottom of society, and begin to destroy the foundation of the society."
"Huh, funny somebody removed my post from this article. The language I used was clean but brutally honest. Maybe someone from the SA staff felt this kind of honesty does not need to go out there... Here's what I said AGAIN.... 
Sad... 90% of the NBA are African Americans and living high off the hog but they feel the need to protest against oppression while causing oppression themselves... I believe, in general, that white people, as well as other races in our country, are not out to get them... They, including this non-white person, are just tired of their violence, petty grievances, constant complaining, blind solidarity, and double standards... In all honesty, we were on track into healing as a country and putting racism behind us... Unfortunately someone came along and started stoking the coals again..."
Hillary received vocal support from the racist Congressional Black Caucus.
"While I agree with the students who are pointing out that what the professor did WAS in fact a blackface performance (a 2016 version if you will) I do not at all believe it would be productive to remove Professor Schurtz from her teaching position although some disciplinary action by her department does seem appropriate given that she invited students over whom she has academic power (if not grading power) to her home to witness her performance. 
It is patronizing in a racist society like ours for a white woman to put an afro-wig on her head, paint her hands and face black in order to imitate an African-American to demonstrate her reaction to his memoir about racism. If she read a moving memoir about a Standing Rock Sioux Indian would she have donned a feathered headdress and ""war paint""? You know Gary all the people that are your age in my family don't really get it either. Remember, I don't think she should be fired but she deserves to be ridiculed. What she did was ridiculous."
"If blacks in America were disturbed by the KKK support of the Trump campaign, why did so many not get off their couches to vote on November 8?"
"The only ""abuse"" of government power here is the slap-on-the-wrist administered to the perp, presumably because of his right-wing politics and his pink skin. If you are poor or black and you use a gun in the commission of a crime on federal lands, while pointing that gun at law enforcement, I can guarantee you that you will not have those charges plea-bargained away. 

Only in America could these serial criminals get a veritable slap-on-the-wrist and their defenders still cavail over the supposed ""injustice"" and ""abuse."" No doubt at all that these same individuals' voices are among the loudest of those screaming for the full application of the rigor of the Law when the perp does not have the magic white skin and right-wing politics to merit a Get Out of Jail Free card."
"And Hillary is pro-family and pro-life??
The huge majority of women and blacks employed by trump contest that he is not a sexist  or a racist."
"No. I showed you the racist innuendos of writing such a post when just two words are changed.

But I do understand you. 
(your view) 
1) It is NOT racist if spoken about the White Race
2) It IS racist if spoken about the Black Race.

Got it. 
And not buying it either.

PS I could Care Less about Black Supremacists or White Supremacists. Never mentioned them and I won't. Only you do and are."
"Au contraire, you have improperly inferred I'm black.  Mote.  Beam.  To AGAIN paraphrase the wisdom of the great Sidney Poitier: ""ASSUME just makes an A$$ of U, not ME.""

However, if I were black, the clearest indication I'm NOT a slave would be that I dismiss with contempt your arrogant attempts to tell me how to think.

And I NEVER 'play the victim'.  Being a victim is never ""play"".  I strive to keep myself and my family from BECOMING victims.

Being a ""victim"" means answering the door some night and being greeted by a uniformed creep who tries to keep the smirk off his face while he informs you one of your kids won't be coming home.  Does that sound like 'play' to you?

And I'll have to work on my gag-reflex before I try to read anything ghost-written for ""CunningLingui$t $pice.""  Thanks anyway."
"And you rely on being black to explain all failures.

You accept no personal responsibility and insist all blacks are the same.

Fortunately, I know many blacks who are and have been successful without needing a crutch like affirmative action so I know that it is just you who feel inadequate."
"I question why we need this movie at this time. Race relations are so fragile, do the Blacks need another reminder of their horrific past? Do Whites need to consider that angry Black mobs can rob and kill innocent people - seeking (Justice?) (Revenge?) pick one. I know all the Free Speech arguments, but this seems like a bit like shouting ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater."
"Black and brown men are gunned down by cops in the streets.  Armed white, cowboy hatted terrorists are allowed to hijack a federal facility, terrorize an entire locality, evict federal workers, and hold area hostage.  All dragging on for months without a shot fired.  One terrorist shot while grabbing for a gun.  All the rest surrender when really confronted by police, again without a shot fired.  All white jury acquits after kicking out a lone dissenting juror.  Unarmed Red Sioux peaceably defend their land and water against a Texas corporate oil billionaire invader and are met with full militarized, black garbed, face shield, armored vests, shotguns, concussion grenades, armored vehicles, National Guard, Bull Connor sheriffs.   Justice?  I think not."
"You're right, black slavery and black discrimination by whites in America is excused."
"No, I'm not denying anything blacks have done for this country. What makes you think I am? Your previous comments equated ""white racists"" with Trump, then with his voters, an absurd leap of logic, and a racist statement. I take exception to that, and would be pleased to see you retract it. We don't need racism of any sort in this country, and I hope we can agree on that!

Nice to hear about your father's service to this country. I salute him, as I do all who have served."
"I too have ancestors. My father was an oppressed black gay man in Trinidad where it was not safe to be gay.  He married my mother who was an Indian (of what sub-tribe we in the family could never discern) lesbian from Jamaica. They married and moved to Cuba to escape prejudice and liven in a Worker's Paradise. I was born physically challenged - no legs - due to a birth defect on my father's side and have Asian features as the result of a recessive gene. I am transgender. I tell you all this so you will understand that I too want Prince Harry to repent and admit that as a white man who speaks good English, he is by definition the enemy of all people with ugly minds named den-hiss, all non-white people whether they are ugly, named dennis, sherry hidustinci ' or even just Jamal Oblatiwhatsinslurkinginaninanename and have relatives going back 5,000 years who are all female. Gay. Indigenous. Incensed. So racist against white people so not really racist.  Correct SJW Denis and PC Hini-Hindi?"
"No one is 'forcing"" this bigoted baker to do anything. He can be hateful towards gays, jews, blacks and women all he likes in his personal life. He can believe anything he wants about groups the disagrees even though it's highly irrational.
But what when he avails himself to the public marketplace he should either abide by the proscribed rules or quit. There is nothing that says baking cakes is practicing religion and nothing about the law that he violated that requires him to believe anything.

I think something that isn't explored is that 99% of those who claim this religions exemption only target one group - homosexuals. They never target adultery or other sins that the bible talks about. This to me shows that it's not really about religion at all."
"You correctly identify part of the problem.

Jesse Jackson once remarked:

""At night when I am walking, if I hear footsteps behind me, I'm always glad to see a white instead of a black person when I turn around.""

Thus, even a noted black leader will lump perfectly innocent, law-abiding, hard-working, honest blacks in with black criminals;  that's definitely unfair.

What is the solution?  Perhaps eliminating entitlement programs which unfairly give an advantage to blacks over other groups.  That causes a great deal of resentment.

Everyone should make a concerted effort to ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.""
That is, always try to be respectful and polite to others, regardless of the color of their skin or social status, even if provoked 

The progressive MSM and US A.G.s, Holder & Lynch, were definitely on the side of blacks who were found to have incited violence -- Treyvon Martin and Michael Brown. That also causes resentment.  Minerva should always be blindfolded."
are these players protesting against Trump or the way blacks are treated in America.
"Why not open yours to my suggestion? Why is it so hard for you to imagine? Look at the differential rates of incarceration - by race - of sexual assault in the US. Think blacks get as fair a trial as whites?
Or perhaps think of this - in some places and cultures being pregnant out of wedlock (or common law etc.) is really not a big deal anymore... in other places and cultures it is a huge deal, heck even marrying the wrong person is a huge deal. And these cultures and places are in Canada. I'm sure you know this.  In some places/cultures there may be quite a bit of pressure to say ""I was raped""... to excuse behaviours others don't like. And of course in some places there is a lot of anger toward men and calling rape is applauded whether it is true or not, e.g. see Mandi Gray."
What you fail to realize is that Donald Trump has hired and cut paychecks to more black latino gay lesbian and transgendered people than all previous presidents put together.
"Governments all over the South are removing those monuments. That's what his statement revealed. 

And that's what Charlottesville was all about. Those ""Unite the Right"" nazis, klansmen, white nationalists, and alt-right kek racists gathered in Charlottesville because the racist snowflakes were super sad that the local government was taking down the monuments to treason, anti-black racism, and white supremacy.

These times are very revealing. Who clings to statues celebrating white supremacy and anti-black, anti-liberty injustice and who wants to at long last fulfill the goals of Reconstruction. I know which side I'm on. Appears you're with the Unite the Right crowd."
"By all means, feel free to invite illegal immigrants to stay in your home, and be sure to give them your social security number too so they can illegally obtain jobs at the expense of unemployed American citizens, many of whom are black, by the way.  How is favoring one ethnic group at the expense of another not a racist position to take?  And your tax information is also misleading as it only accounts for state and local taxes, and not federal.  A disproportionately high number of illegals probably live in high tax CA, and that statistic conveniently makes no mention of the flip side of the coin - how much the states spend on services directly and indirectly linked to their illegal populations."
"A democratic SA??? All the ANC has gained for it's people is the ""right to vote"", and wealth for a hand full of corrupt cadre's pockets!! The rest of the masses have to survive on crime and welfare!! Malema... if that's what your perception of democracy is, then YES, the ANC has created a democratic SA!! I'm sure a lot of people, black and white, are missing the old flag and a regular job that puts food on the table!! So malema, when you've solved SA's problems in your racist ways, the you can run to Israel to solve their problems as well!!"
"I never said they were never in Colorado.  I said they are no longer here and haven't been in 50 years (it's actually 38 since the last one but them being here in significant numbers goes back to the 1950s).  So you seem to read poorly and seem to forget that it was you who claimed that this guy hit a grizzly bear.  You don't know much about Colorado wildlife.  Probably couldn't tell an elk from a deer from a moose from an antelope.  And doubtful you've ever seen a black bear in the wild.  It's been proven that this driver was an idiot and there is no way he and other members of his family should have died from hitting a black bear.  So basically, you have no point and are being nothing but a troll who is hoping to find some sort of validity.  I sure hope you don't drive."
"No one is rewriting history, Bill. The history is still there, even if the monuments to Jim Crow are in some museum out of the sight of a public including black people whose grandfathers were lynched during the Jim Crow troubles."
"Also, if you take out inner city gun violence (i.e. young black males shooting young black males) The statistics are very surprising indeed... take a minute and look it up"
Maybe not but we now know the anti-war protesters were simply using Russian propaganda as their main arguments. Black Lives Mater is is a violent racist group that has created a false narrative and calls for killing cops. If the owners of NFL teams will allow their players to support that cause they are just as culpable
"More proof that the opposition to Obama was because he was a black man in the White House. I'm awaiting the downvotes from the usual bigots and apologists. You cannot justify this. No way, no how. Trump is doing everything you said you hated about Obama. The Trumpanzees will never admit it, however..."
"""And don't worry, my standards are the same for everyone.""

And yet you use the derogatory terms ""thumpers"" and ""holy rollers"" for Christians. I guess I dont want to hear what you call Muslims or gays or blacks or women if your standards are truly the same."
LOL Don't you know that Chief Saunders and the Mayor and the media want us to believe that that the majority of the violent crime isn't coming from the black community. Shhh... it's a secret that we're supposed to be blind to even though they are actually COLLUDING to show us how the black community are total angels! Of course when you are like me and live in the black community where it isn't safe to go out after dark and get woken up regularly to the sounds of them shooting at each other and even SEE them shooting at each other  AND you go to stores to see them shop lifting AND AND AND...  it's NOT really happening . Don't see the man behind the curtain pushing buttons cause he's not there!!!!! Tired of the excuses and bull Saunders and Tory spew out - they could fix the problem but they don't so excuse me if I give them the contempt they deserve!
"I just clicked yes to comments I admittedly didn't read. One was a reference to Madaonna giving oral sex which I have to admit I was shocked to learn. I thought she was a well mannered nice girl, by I digress.

I then received a black warning notice stating if I keep approving comments that were not deemed civil I would have my access cut off."
"Where to start! Deporter in chief, now that's laugh, he simply changed the way deportations were counted. Changing the law and giving illegal aliens the right to work was a little over the top. Making Micheal Brown a national hero because he was shot by a white cop had a big effect on the BLM (Black lies Murder) movement. Every time some black thug was shot, Obama and his racist AG Eric Holder was in there hot and heavy. 
Speaking of Eric Holder we could add his Fast and Furious disaster that ended with a dead border patrol officer and Holder lying to Congress regarding it. And who could forget having Lois Lerner weaponizing the IRS against conservative supporters. And that we have the lies and more lies regarding Benghzai were 4 brave patriots were abandoned and sacrificed. 
Oh the list just goes on and on but I am running out of characters in this posting. Bottom line Obama was a sleaze ball and the worse President in the history of our country."
"So the City and Colorado should ask themselves why blacks hold so many key government positions?...You must love Nascar, Jesus, and that Confederate flag. Enjoy retirement."
"Actually, I have been to two of those I mentioned.  Not a great idea, just necessary at the time.  

One of my fondest memories is telling a story to a black soldier friend about Major Tom Egan being in Oakland after dark and his response: 

""Man!  Black people that don't live there don't go into Oakland after dark!""  ""What was that fool thinkin'?!"
"Apparently, traveling to the protest with his weapon and bringing along 4 extra ‘high capacity’ clips for his gun…..  and ‘staging’  a confrontation  claiming unarmed people are shoving,  punching and kicking you and forcing you to draw your weapon because you fear for your life from attacks via ‘hand to hand combat’……………..  looks a little like planning ahead to commit a mass shooting,  especially when those you claim are punching and kicking you are more than 15 feet away from you and could not have reached you, let alone punch and kick you….   Silly justice system,  he is a white man brandishing a gun,   his intentions MUST be honorable, Purposely traveling to a place that has been scheduled to have a peaceful  ‘black lives matter[too]’ and noticing there are black people there, would make any good RW  coward  fear for their life"
"""Trump should listen..."" are you guys living in reality? Have you been asleep for the last two years? Trump should LISTEN?! That's rich! The man won't listen and he'll go right on showing his contempt for liberal democracy. He represents psychopaths who want to stick it to the blacks, stick it to the liberals, stick it to cities, stick it to women, stick it planetary environmental health, stick it to equality, stick it to human decency, stick it to progress, stick it to integrity, stick it to reason itself. He is the cresting wave of our profound national social malaise:  pathology and avarice now rule society and government in tyranny, with fear, division, a platform of gaslighting, subversion of The People's duties, PsyOps perpetuated against The People, and a perverse commitment to profound farce and falseness as they despoil all. Take him out of office? Then you've got that zealous psychopath, Pence. Out of frying pan, into fire."
"I admit that I'm glad the North won the Civil War. There were over 200,000 black troops that made the win possible. Millions of black slaves  provided intelligence for the North. What exactly have I done to white folks that make me a racist?  Do you need me to give you a hug? Are you denying our sacrifices for this country. We have fought in every war this country has had. Heck, the first man killed in  the Boston Massacre was a black sailor that worked for John Hancock. My father was a Tuskegee airman in WWII. Had to fight Nazis and white racists. Are you grateful for the contributions of black folks for this nation as 2nd class citizens? We have been here longer than most white families."
"When we remove the words ""Democrat"" and ""Republican"" and substitute them for Liberal and Conservative, we get a much clearer picture. The liberal notion that people shouldn't own people started the Civil War when angry conservatives declared they'd sooner quit the union than give up their (human) property. When that failed, Conservatives at least tried to maintain the status quo of Blacks being subhumans not entitled to all the other rights that go along with not being property, and the Liberals fought a hundred years to reverse that, finally passing laws requiring that Blacks enjoy the same freedoms as Whites, over the opposition of Conservatives. The Conservatives have slowly chipped away at those rights, and now, we have Conservatives rioting in the streets to bring back not only the disrespect of Black rights, but Gay, Jew, Hispanic, Muslim, and...well, rights of anyone else who disagrees with them, including other Whites!"
"From what I saw on the video......this career criminal and sex offender with a record as long as anyone's arm.....was resisting the officers. He had a gun he was trying to pull out and when the officers realized that, they told him to stop but he kept on making the effort to pull out the gun. Anyone in that situation, officers or not, would have shot the guy. It funny that if this was about two black officers and dead black criminal.....there would be no hoopla over this incident.

Actually, I read on Yahoo that they did recovered the gun Mr. Sterling was trying to use. And also.....one of his sex offenses was against a child.  This guy wasn't no Baptist minister on his way to church but a career criminal refusing to obey a lawful orders given by a law enforcement officers."
"Who could forget that video. It might have been that black folks, with all they've been through, could hope that modern technology would at last give them a fighting chance in these deadly confrontations: surely, if you could catch it all with a camera... but no, not even that's enough. Apparently all a trigger-happy cop has to do in court is indicate he felt threatened and express his remorse. But that poor woman in the bloodied car, somehow doing everything right, her little girl there too, her law-abiding boyfriend blown away by a panicky officer of the law... that's some officer, some law, some country."
"Disagree.  I would say most people don't give a flying fig... whether you're trans or not, gay or not, rich or not, black white green or not... but ""not caring"" is more in the vein of ""An it harm none do what ye will"" as opposed to ""it's weird and I'm gonna pretend it doesn't exist"".

To the OP: much empathy.  It must be hard enough being a member of a truly rare and misunderstood community without having band wagoners jump on board, diluting and distorting a very real issue for their own narcissistic and myopic views."
"While I agree that thoughts 140 characters at a time, or criticism and cynicism, are the current state of affairs, I see the difference as noted by Thomas Freedman of wall vs web people as a real difference. And a real separating between the cave and community, between empathy and anger...yes all lives should matter but blacks lives don't matter enough to too many....and blue lives matter but SWAT teams are not good policing -- they are a sign of failure. Is that too critical? Once I realized that criticism is the lowest form of analysis, like puns are the lowest form of humor, I came to appreciate that all things are messy, all people a bit silly, and this is part of being human. It helps...I miss Bloom County. Bill the Cat would have been a perfect running mate for the little 'd.'"
"You must be a Republican.  Swirling black hole where your heart should be ... Hatriotism!!  Praying hard to the money gods while calling yourself a Christian, but we all know by now today's Christian is a 'christian'.  Super fakey!"
"With all your hysteric comments about ""white supremacy"" and us being the most violent nation.  Remember this: Black men are  primarily responsible for that.  They are only 3.5% of the entire population and yet they commit 52% of the Homicides!!!  They are 40 times, not twice, not triple, not 10 times, but FORTY times more likely to commit a violent crime than white men.  Look it up on the DOJ data.  Further Muslims have killed way more Christians than the other way around, do some research Charles."
"Wrong-winger bigots and racists aren't about to yield one iota of credit to our classy President Barack Obama for saving our nation from going over the Republicants fiscal cliff.  That's ok, we don't need their support or approval. And if you think anti-Obama haters hate him for doing all the things that he accomplished, think again.  They hate him because he's black. Period.  We've witnessed their bigot/racist comments about President Obama on a weekly basis."
"Criticize Obama, the left says you're racist. Criticize Clinton, the left says you're sexist. The left criticizes Carson, they're concerned about his qualifications. The left criticizes Palin, they're concerned about her ignorance. I don't first think those who disagree with Carson do so because he is black, as most who disagree with Obama don't do so because he is black. Let's keep that in mind for the future. I'm concerned about the Trumpster's experience to be Prez and the same about Carson and his role at HUD. I am hopeful that their experience and gut instincts will bust through establishment politics and bureaucracy for the better of all. Sorry Palin fans, I'm sure most people are concerned about her ignorance not her sex. So, let's stop the race, homophobe, sexist bull because that is not what drives the vast majority of ideological differences. Throwing out that junk indicates your inability to engage in civil discourse and explain your ideology. We shall see."
"This is a rather ""gut-wrenching"" little thread of conversation.  May I offer my view: Charles Dalton is a very angry black man who has, (yes, in his opinion) experienced a lifetime of racial discrimination.  Those who respond to his condemnation of ""white privilege"" and his visceral anger toward ""white America"" strike back with their own anger.  It's all so very ugly and counterproductive.  Will Charles ever ""overcome"" his disdain for the ""white supremacy"" he sees as central to American culture?  Will those of us who were born and have lived ""white"" ever really understand his feelings?  Is any kind of resolution of this terrible struggle possible?  

We elected a black man President and I, optimistically, though we were ""on the way"" toward racial harmony....boy, was I ever stupid.  Instead, every racist in the country saw the election as a license to express and act upon ""closeted"" racism.  (cont)"
"Can I hear myself? How about you Mekun, do you hear Steve Bannon?  This particular Trumpite said he “didn’t want the girls going to school with Jews...He said he doesn’t like Jews...""

Yes Mekun, I hear myself fine.  Do you?"
"Why don't you focus your racism fervour on the continuing African slave trade in Africa and Islamic ME.

You can subpoena me, and I will defer  you to MOTLEY.................."
What about the slasher in Portland? What about the guy who shot up the Indians think they were Muslim?  Or even the kids who filmed the black guy drowning and did nothing.  You are just going to conveniently ignore those?
"It's the law. You can't discriminate against a couple solely because they are gay or lesbian.
Anymore than you can discriminate against blacks or Roman Catholics or disabled people.
If skinheads want meat from a kosher butcher, and they are polite customers, they have every right to be served. If they harass the butcher, that's criminal behavior.

It is amazing how many people were fine with civil rights laws -- until they included gay people."

"Why many Canadians will NOT be observing Remembrance Day.
It makes NO mention of the sacrifices of the millions of non-White subjects of the European empires who gave their lives foolishly for their White masters ... and for what?

""Faced with manpower shortages, British imperialists had recruited up to 1.4 million Indian soldiers. France enlisted nearly 500,000 troops from its colonies in Africa and Indochina.

"Meanwhile,  as one ""conspirator"" after another is charged with a misdemeanor or found not guilty,  Lavoie Finicum is still dead,  shot from ambush by  Oregon State Police sniper team members while the Feds were shooting at the people in the car.  Those are the same Oregon State Police that are never to be involved with telling,  let alone handling,  an alien felon is in custody or is about to be released.  The hypocrisy of this Brown Government is disingenuous at the least,  and basically dishonest up front.  BLM ought to join with the ""white trash"" and run the lefty elites out of office.  Problem is that 75% of the State is white trash and the African American demographic is now less than 2%."
"To suggest BLM wants to kill all white cops is right wing rhetoric dribble.  What they want is equal treatment from cops when being pulled over, or for having a legal gun, or for, you know, just walking the streets.
Yes, there ARE bad eggs in that group, just like there are bad eggs in nearly every group - but that group was not founded on ""kill all white cops"".  The core concept of that group is to get equal treatment.  Whereas the core concept of White Nationalists is the elimination of anyone who does not look like them. 
You suggesting that BLM is ""the same"" as White Nationalists actually gives more power to White Nationalists because you are equating them to a movement towards equality.  Which they are anything but that.  To prove my point, how many black people do you see joining the White Nationalists?  Where as BLM is not exclusive to black people, and many people who support that movement are in fact white, and latino, and gay, and straight, and jewish and muslim."

When Trump retweeted the account @WhiteGenocideTM, the publisher of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer could barely contain his excitement. 

“Our Glorious Leader and ULTIMATE SAVIOR has gone full-wink-wink-wink to his most aggressive supporters,” he wrote. “Whereas the odd White genocide tweet could be a random occurrence, it isn’t statistically possible that two of them back to back could be a random occurrence. It could only be deliberate.”"

"""A freshman legislator in the Alaska House of Representatives has demonstrated to this fallibility by pushing his hate-based agenda since taking office – against black Alaskans, Alaska Natives, and Alaskan women, so far. While some of his behavior since taking office has caused some concern, most of us can agree that he crossed a line this week when he verbally abused the women of Alaska, specifically targeting our sisters who live in village and rural Alaska.""

Hold on a second... pushing a ""hate-based agenda"" that disparages ""black Alaskans, Alaska Natives, and Alaskan women"" causes ""some concern"" to the authors of this op-ed, but he only ""crossed the line"" after ""he verbally abused the women of Alaska""? 

For the record, I believe Rep. Eastman's comments were shameful. This, however, is the worst possible response I could have imagined."

"Except that apparently nobody who listened to the show understands how an analogy works. 

She was *asked* to give a perspective of how black people feel about Apartheid, and used the bully analogy outlined in the article. She didn't call white people bullies, she simply explained that the black perspective of Apartheid is like having your bicycle taken away by a bully, and when your parents intervene, instead of chastising the bully, they tell you that you have to share the bike with him.

Which, to me, is a pretty on-the-nose description of how white people came out of the Apartheid era, and should really give a clearer picture as to why many black people are still angry about things, 25 years later.

But typically, instead of having a meaningful conversation about racial politics and the Apartheid legacy, white listeners immediately tried to bully the station by threatening to withdraw listenership and advertising money, without even the slightest hint of irony!"
Please explain the difference with white people having a rally for their race versus all of the rallies we've seen for blacks and hispanics? They are all xenocentric.

"This article, while informative, acts in some ways to reinforce divisions and support stereotypes. Using ""black activist"" Royal Harris' quote about ""really white Portland"" not being able to face reality is exactly the kind of generalization based on skin color that he's criticizing, as well as false and insulting for many of us. But even though he said it, it didn't have to be used in the article. And what does the fact that Montague is a ""skinny white kid"" or ""nobody's idea of a militant activist"" have to do with anything? Does his appearance or skin color or the fact that he lives what is an ordinary life mean he can't, shouldn't, or is somehow unlikely to care about unjust murders or say something? Or that Black Lives Matter activists are all militant simply because they oppose what is clearly wrong. Or that it's radical to do what's right? Too often the press, even in efforts to correct injustice, uses the same bullshit assumptions as what it criticizes, thus failing to help."
"This is an issue of stereotypes.  Blacks ganged up, Italians mobbed up, Chinese, hard working and industrious but ganging quietly, phillipinoes, and Hispanics, the new middle class.... and grumpy old white men embezzling corporate profits.  All brought to you buy Hollywood and mass media."
No I don't. The US has something pathologically wrong with themselves on the subject. I suspect that it is racism at its heart. The white majority would feel that they were being 'robbed' if their taxes were being used to 'give' healthcare to little black babies.
That's like the dems and liberal pots calling the kettle black.l
"HI G:
Sorry these were two black fellows."
"The truth is that black men make up less than 7% of the population but account for over 50% of violent crime. If black men are being shot at a higher percentage than other groups (which FBI stats seem to refute) perhaps it's due to such a small population committing a disproportionate number of violent crime?  Blacks are killing one another by the hundreds in Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit,  Cleveland, etc but not a word of protest from any of the cowards in the NFL or Hollywood who are so concerned for poor black people."
"Sounds like the police handled this situation well. There are countless and routine scenarios across America where if a black man answered the door with such a gun, even sober and not threatening and even without a gun, that it would not end so well.

Racial bias is not the only thing at work when it comes to international conspiracy theories.   

Nobody in my circle of friends denies that their is racial antipathy on the black side as well.    We can most certainly agree that the reasons for the antipathy are different, but it exist in both directions.      The power difference is much different in favor of wealth and the damages are historically are nothing close to similar.     

I don't make that out at equal or balanced at all.      

But that is not to say black bias and sometimes deadly violence that goes with it, does not exist and it should certainly be addressed.   It would save thousands of black lives."

The lynching tradition usually is started by a white woman claiming a black man insulted her. Then white men would get their guns and hunt black people. When they caught a black man they had a variety of methods to torture and kill him in front of a happy crowd of white people having picnics. There are photos. Oh the irony."

Isn't that what we are celebrating with memorials of them? What are we celebrating with a memorial of Lee? Killing blacks and fellow whites to sustain slavery and white rule? Don't you think there's some difference there? Now if we follow your train of thought, why are there so many memorials and monuments to Christian faith? Isn't that religion responsible for more horrendous deaths and horrific acts than any other?"

How low the GOP has sunk. The GOP is now the George Wallace party. The GOP is now the party of anti-black segregation. Is it any wonder why 95 percent of black Americans don't vote Republican? Every chance Republican voters get, you keep demonstrating to black Americans that they aren't welcome in your party or, given your choice for president, in your neighborhood. When you vote for an anti-black segregationist, you can't even pretend to respect black Americans anymore so stop saying ""respectfully"". You don't mean it. Racist segregationist party elects a racist segregationist. Doesn't sound very ""respectful"" to me."

WOW. You dare attempt to school me on what Black people want and what they are capable of, OK. Let's see if I can keep this civil here. As a ""well to do White guy"" (YOUR words), you have very little to fear from either a Trump or Clinton regime. I do though, from both, and here's what I can tell you if you'd be willing to not be a snarky wiseass and listen. In 1994 when her husband was signing his ruinous crime bill, Shillary referred to Black youths as ""animals"" and ""super predators"". And in 1989 when 5 Black and Latino kids were falsely accused, arrested, tried, and convicted in the rape of a Central Park jogger, Trump took out a full page ad in the NYT calling for the EXECUTION of these boys."
Who is more marginalized than women?  Hmm--Alaska Native and American Indian students whose school leaders believe they can't learn?  Young black men who are automatically assumed to be criminals if they drive a nice car?  Legal immigrants who are assumed to be illegal?  People with disabilities?

Acting like a victim will not help you either. No one wants to hire a loser. BTW, more than 90% of the folks I served to get my retirement were white folks here in Oregon.

"Blacks have been marginalized for centuries in the US, arguably our own indiginous people have been as well - yet neither descended into the murderous cult that radicalized Muslims represent.  Many radicals are in fact - not destitute or marginalized. The difference is Islam itself - because of it's many interpretations, it is the ""enabler"" that provides the twisted justification for heinous acts. To what end? Who cares! The solution is starting to form but doesn't seem to get much play in the media - the solution is with the Imams. A cohesive organization of ALL Imams in Canada that publicly and continually  shoot down the notion of Jihad and terrorism - and to publicly accuse all terrorists of apostacy - of sullying the name of Allah.  Canadian Imams should have leadership that has the authority to monitor mosques, Imams and their teachings - in a helpful and respectful way. Can't speak for the rest of the world but it would seem that Canadian Muslims can fix things here."

"If law enforcement were truly concerned about white supremacists, the cops would be all the ""AntiFa"" that was needed. But they're not that concerned. Nor are many American police departments all that convinced that black lives matter.

"It's rather odd that the both sides of this income fracture are primarily Liberal in nature.

Thus it's odd that the white liberal areas are growing richer and richer while the minority run areas are getting poorer and poorer, as Ley's study shows.

I thought the opposite was the effect favoured by Liberals.

Go to metro Vancouver though and you will find that the mainly caucasian Liberal areas like the blocks around West 4th are as ghettoized as the Asian neighbourhoods in Richmond. Bring in minorities into those white run Liberal areas and there will probably be white flight. The caucasians in Liberal West 4th and surroundings are the kind who would hop over to the other sidewalk if they saw an aboriginal or a black walking towards them.

Puzzling indeed."
"I've said it many times before, and I'll say it again. America learned to walk on violence. Like a toddler. Slavery and the wanton killing of Black slaves for ""standing"" up to their white owners begat murder and mayhem. Killing Native Americans at will and for their lands came next. There is no other explanation. A nation brought up on a murderous legacy is what we are dealing with now. Until America turns to face itself on all these counts, nothing will change."
"No, he nailed it. The blacks who resemble the negative stereotype are not a threat to the livelihood of the average white. Those who work hard and achieve are a “threat” because they represent real competition and could end up taking your job or being your boss. Now many people, me included, don’t really care what colour (or gender) their boss is as long as they do a good job. There are still some, however, who would be bothered by that scenario, just as there were some who were bothered by Obama being in the White House before he even started the job. As an a further point, note how most Americans are hyphenated as ******- American rather than just American."
"Linda seems to be a bit clueless about what racial terminology is. Yes, slants is not a very common name for Asians but Orientals is.

"If you think you choose your gender preference you are out of your depth.  No one in his or her right mind would pick to be gay in this world right now.  You are very, very, very sadly mistaken.

Yep, I think I'll choose to like the opposite gender pool for finding my soul mate.'""  Nope, sorry, it's not a choice.  And that idea has been debunked for decades.  Get over it.  Meanwhile, my understanding is that some Black people resent the equation because it is much harder to pass as white when you are black than to pass as straight when you are gay.  The discrimination is more universally and automatically felt by Black people in a white-dominated world.   The racial stereotypes against African Americans has been, perhaps, more institutionally marginalizing than for gays."
"It used to be easy, say in Alabama, to get a death penalty on flimsy or concocted evidence from a white jury in the case of a poor and innocent black defendant.

LOL) but were still on welfare (and paid by the welfare system to vote Democratic LOL) because the system penalized black people (but not white people, I guess LOL) for getting married?

The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else?

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

"Up to date you still cannot comprehend that it was an officially, deliberate and caculated response by the Western as this was black on black violence. For as long as the White Zimbos were not touched it would be business as usually unfortunately 10 years laters it was  the White population's turn. Guess what twenty years later the Madman unleached his venom on the Zezurus, Korekores, Manyika........."
"The rallies of many types of groups have individuals who try to shout down those with whom they disagree.  
BLM has once again raised the question of the way that white society tends to disregard black lives.  This makes many uncomfortable, but it's an issue that must be raised and addressed if we are ever to live in a just society."
"It was a good racial chat, now that nobody can Aretha Franklin for halloween any longer, lets all forget about dressing up for the school play unless your black. Cant have a black barbie if ur white. This is judgemental!"
"The way I remember Bill Curtis narrate the drug history in the USA is that prohibition of MJ targeted Latinos, not Blacks; and that ""crazed Negro"" was the fig leaf behind cocaine prohibition.

 This being said, the tide really turned on drugs after an epic epidemic of opioid abuse after Civil War in US, and at the turn of the 20th century - worldwide."
"NRA - check.  Remember back in 1967?
""The National Rifle Association, which in 1967 supported the repeal of California's open-carry law when members of the Black Panther Party began carrying legally purchased firearms, said gun control ""will do nothing"" to stop gun violence, and then urged Congress to allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons across state lines; and at least 64 members of Congress who've accepted campaign contributions from the NRA announced that they would pray for the victims in Las Vegas, including a representative who said gun control was ""not the answer"" and who once spoke at an international white-supremacist conference, authored a bill banning gay marriage in Louisiana, and was, after being shot by a 66-year-old white man, defended by a black female police officer who is married to a woman, a demographic in the United States that is a hundred times more likely to be shot and killed by a man than to use a gun for self-defense."" [ Joe Kloc, Harper's]"
"""One thing hasn’t changed, though. People stand together.""

Yeah, and Drumpf is now POTUS. Way to stand divided ladies.

How can ANY woman vote for Drumpf??? I have 3 daughters. I couldn't look them in the eye, nor could I be hypocritical with my two boys.

White guys have been screwing things up for centuries. I can see why Drumpfs base is white guys. I can also see why Drumpf is POTUS. Drumpf is POTUS because women voted for Drumpf.

""American women voted overwhelmingly for Clinton, except the white ones""

                    Clinton                    Trump    
White women 51%                         45%                             
Hispanic women 65%                    28%
Non-white women 76%                 19%
Black women 91%                         6%

Notice that white women put Drumpf in the seat. How's the Hispanic ladies feeling about that Drumpf vote? I know one thing, Drumpf has had an effect on my kids. Everyones kids. 

Women are master organizers. I'm hopeful."
You forget the misogynist (both black and white women included) because apparently a woman cant do that job.
"Hate crimes perpetrated by blacks are VERY rarely reported or charged as such. It's so common, it's become a case of ""dog bites man."""
"Trump has never done anything that didn't benefit him first. He is 70 years old and not going to change. He loves the ""poorly educated"" because they are easy to con. Globalization is hard on the poorly educated, including poorly educated white people. The only thing worse for them would be the trade war he promised. Of course, they will enjoy the weekly police shootings of unarmed black people. Those whites enjoy that almost as much as their elders enjoyed watching lynchings."
How is it racist? he never said black inmates or asian inmates. I've heard that expression used throughout my life and never did I ever assume there was any racial tilt to that saying. Perhaps you're the racist because in your mind the word inmate automatically makes you think an inmate is other than white?
"Degrees?

Not really - but they are required yes. Where I live, the steel industry dominates - used to be filled with non-college educated blacks and whites (who made a very good living off of US Steel and Inland - ArcelorMittal now).

Now they want you to have a bachelors just to sweep the floors unless you're cheap imported foreign labor."
"Really , In the NFL , you are forced to interview a Black for head coach, the Blacks are about 75 % of the team , NBA Blacks are 99.9 % of the team, in the Movies, they are 50 % of the actors and in commercials they are 50 % ! So why do they  feel like they are persecuted by White people ? They disrespect the USA by kneeling , the Flag  stands for America, Love it or Leave it !"
"""The suspect said he was upset at white people. The suspect stated that he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers,"" said Brown, who is African-American.""

"Being as we live in his fiefdom now, the first thing I noticed was that Granpa Comment Section sounds like he’s sundowning again.

"Unfortunately, you cannot say ""we should truly forgive..."" if you are a white man. This is SA after all. Only a black man may say that.

"The anti-trump movement in the Republican Party is exaggerated. Only a small minority of the hundreds of Republicans in Congress are speaking up and the criticism is weak or related to one thing like Charlottesville. Polls show 80% of Republicans favor Trump over Congress. Trump's recent statements and his pardoning of Arpaio show he is tapping into a strong base within this 80%-- a part of the 89%--which sees blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and non-whites as the cause of the country's problems-- a base that was hidden by things like political correctness but is now more visible. Republicans in congress may not express these views or share them, but Trump's supporters do. The mainstream Republicans cannot deal with this and risk losing this same group of supporters they need to get elected. 70 Percent of the US population is white and we are finding that more whites do hold the racial views of many Trump supporters. If you are from a white Republican district you keep quiet."
"Being black is tough. Being a woman is also tough. Two strikes  there. In the early 80's, as a petite blonde woman who chose veterinary medicine as a career, I can tell you that getting a job there wasn't an easy slog either. It didn't take me long to get over my my hopes to have a career in the dairy industry. It's funny how women can take a major role in the drudge work of farming, but that was only ok if you weren't being paid for professional services. Things have changed. I think a lot. ..... But I don't agree that there is a preference for people to choose associates who look like themselves. They  choose people who look like the people they grew up with and saw in those positions they are hiring for. After all I never met a Golden Retriever who much cared that the dog next door was a black lab. Afterall, you don't really see yourself. You see what's around you. Put another way, the more black female lawyers there are today, the more there will be tomorrow."
"Actually, that is exactly what I was thinking too. They could have insisted on Indian staff. Or non-black staff, but they specifically wanted white."
"There are also videos of blacks attacking whites.  I wonder why we almost never here about these on the nation news,

"Translation: area is crime ridden, most of offenders are black; therefore must be white people's fault. What a pitiful article."
"It has nothing to do with how much money someone makes. People in the military and vets all have a whole different level of commitment and value system. Not standing for the National Anthem and the flag is about as derogatory as a racial slur. It's like calling a black man the ""N"" word. You hear nothing after that. Your whole message is lost and now you have pissed off a whole segment of the fan base. We come to games to get away from all of this B.S. I myself served 8 years in the Army and when I saw this it was and is a spit in the face. I also am a season ticket holder that will not be there this Sunday for the first time in 15 years. This is about as offensive as it gets and I won't be apart of such nonsense. People who have never served really don't understand the dedication we have for our country. And we don't expect them to, just don't make a mockery of our service and sacrifice."
"Barry may be intelligent, but he's also a condescending, opinionated, pansy who, in my opinion, was ill qualified to be president, was elected because he was a black man who could speak well, and has taken this country in the wrong direction in several ways. The most notable being the ill conceived Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that is currently crumbling due to its inherent faults.
That doesn't mean that Trump will do better. A Trump administration will offer many significant challenges. I can only hope that those leaders in Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, will hold the line on any legislation Trump may propose that is inimical to the good health of our nation.
As to the ridiculousness of my statement, it's true and accurate. When Barry was elected and re-elected, I was depressed for weeks. I know what Friedman and many Clinton supporters are going through and they have my sincere sympathy."
"A terrorist group may not be protected...but an individual citizen who may sympathize with a terrorist group could be. He doesn't have to be a member of the KKK. Just a guy who likes the KKK and takes delight in screwing with this black business owners because he resents the fact that he is a business owner and not a janitor or a share cropper. I am making it complicated because I see the law as protecting ONE group of people and saying ""screw you"" to all other minority groups. In this example the Baker in the case has stopped making wedding cakes. It would be a shame if a Jewish or Black or Latino or Asian baker had to make the same type of decision when they harbor no ill will towards anyone other than those who harbor ill will towards them.

"Famous white guy in 2017 (Harvey Weinstein) accused of multiple counts of harassment by women, media responds within weeks with hundreds and hundreds of followup stories about dozens of other white guys accused of harassment.

Famous black guy in 2014 (Bill Cosby) accused of multiple counts of harassment by women, media responds within weeks with, well, with approximately zero followup stories about other black guys accused of harassment.

Is that an example of reverse racism?"
"Hey Charles, sounds like some good advice, so, if you really care about all black lives and not just the extremely small amount killed by police, (usually due to their own decisions) why don't you use that 40 years of experience and go into the inner cities where bad choices are getting so many black lives killed daily and try and help? Or do you find it easier to just spew your racism here and bemoan the results of 50 years of dems ruling the inner cities? Do you really care about all black lives Charles?  Do you really want change? Or are you content being used and keeping up the racism? If you don't care about all lives then it's okay to continue with your hate, just please quit blaming others for the bad decisions you support that have failed so 
 many so miserably."
"So let me get this straight, Republicans will vote for a corporate shill reality show star bigot who has insulted every walk of life including a gold star family, but chastise a man practicing his freedom of speech because he's half black and not a patriot? Hmm."
"...and Juan Williams.
If they want a black guy, hire Larry Elder...he's great!"
"That will never happen,they will not allow a conversation because that will mean they will have to take action themselves,that will never happen,nothing came of the protests last year,protesting this way serves no purpose at all,they say we need to talk,but if the first words that come out are you white people need to,they blame white people for there problems and that's not the problem,they take no personal responsibility for there own lives,they commit crimes at a lot higher rate than other races there communities are in shambles and they keep electing those that don't care about them,Obama had eight years to make a difference and made things worse,Obama set back race relations almost fifty years.You have men like Ben Carson who was raised in poverty with a single mom like seventy percent in the black community today he made it out his example should be an inspiration to black people but they look up to athletes and rappers,they don't want the help,they need a mirror hypocrites.smh"

"Crutcher  was another loser with a record. While I believe there are cases where LEO abuse their power towards black people, this particular case is not about race. Cops ran his plates and knew who he was which is why they approached him the way they did. The fact he was photographed wearing an ankle holster with a pulled up pant leg and he had a gun is proof. 

The disturbing part in this case is the wife who KNEW he was violent and had a gun. She KNEW he had a gun, and all does is yell that ""he does NOT have a gun, he does NOT have a gun!"" She claimed he had a TBI. 

WHY? Was she hoping to convince cops he was mentally unstable so they wouldn't follow protocol? Was she hoping they let their guard down so he could shoot them? Why would she LIE? 

God forbid someone who doesn't have a gun does have a TBI is in this situation. No wonder cops have to treat people as if they are truly a threat and a danger at all times. She should be charged. She knowingly put all LEO in danger. Charges!!"
"They should all be given long sentences and thrown in prison like they did during the crack epidemic, but of course  that situation involved  a bunch o black and brown people, so now it's treatment, sympathy, and a public health emergency.

"While Mr. Obama was in office, you wrote relentlessly racist comments here every day about both Mr. & Mrs. Obama.  References to jungles and such.  Every day.  You didn't like Mr. Obama because he's black.  The written evidence created by your own hand was grotesque and constant."
"Your ""source"" is a left wing parroting of the usual ""they have more so they can't be victims"" canard. Sadly and predictably, you don't know a correlation/causation argument when you see one. Your article's ENTIRE premise is that black people have less stuff so they are necessarily victims of the group that has more stuff who is making the black folks have less stuff.

Why don't you ask why these leftist writers you like to source never discuss the per capita demographic breakdown of who commits the most hate crimes and the group that's the largest victims of it? 

Trust me, you won't like it. 

Your article is a perfect example of racial harassment of whites: It scapegoats white people left and right and basically states that they can't be victims of racism because they have more stuff. That assertion is racist unto itself, so you may actually want to dig for legit data."
"Statically a white man gets shot and killed way more often then black men. Even though more crimes are committed by black men.

Left Wing hallucination
Trump hates all mexicans because he wants a wall to keep out Mexican criminals, rapists and drug cartels. Mexico has 6x the murder rate of the USA and only 3% of murders are solved there and far fewer rapes than that are solved.
Trump hates all Muslims because he calls out Islamic terrorism and wants to block mass immigration from Muslim countries controlled by terrorists or warlords.
Trump is a Nazi sympathizer because he called out anti fa violence AND condemned the Nazis and KKK in the same press conference and said that some good people were also protesting the removal of the Robert E Lee statue ( that is true), infact most americans oppose statue removal.."
"We need to stop giving major institutions unabashed praise all the time.   We are supposed to call all men and women in uniform heroes.  Well, we have many cases recently where Naval officers sold secrets for bribes of liquor, prostitution, what have you.  We have the Army now trying to institute a major mental health program for officers because there is such a crisis of competence and ethics among them.  We could go on about the number of times there is a gun death of a civilian and an ex Marine is called the culprit (including going to New York City to kill a black stranger in the cause of white supremacy).

And Christians steal, cheat on income tax,  exploit their employees, shoot their wives and children,  support wars of aggression, and don't mind telling lies to get us into these wars.  Their pastors don't call them out any more.  Study religious texts, find your own religious belief....and if you must join something, join the Quakers or the Unitarians."
"When the Germans came they were treated like dirt. When the Irish came, they were treated like dirt. Your history revision is profound ignorance of basic American history.

Indeed, the culture war is making many liberals filthy rich exploiting race and class.
 Tell me, where are the protests from the black community over blacks killing blacks? Like Hillary Clinton they blame everyone but themselves. It's whitey's fault they kill each other [sic.]

I am a very proud member and volunteer attorney for the ACLU.  Since you have made it your life's work to remain absolutely and completely ignorant about the Constitution, nothing I write here will be absorbed by you.  But others may actually want to learn something.

You (remarkably) keep making the same First Amendment mistakes you always make here.  The Constitution limits the power of government - not the power of private companies.

"Why aren't Republicans doing anything to change the situation with blacks trapped in the inner cities? If what you say is true, Republicans could easily take the black vote by improving the lives of those, white or black, trapped in impoverished ghettos. But they don't, and everyone knows it. It is people like you who keep black people down. You are a bigot, big time, Phil. An ignorant bigot, to boot, but what other kind is there. I have lived in poor inner city black neighborhoods, Phil, and I have never encountered the degree of racism that you display.

"As a fan of the Broncos for 47 years, I will no longer support them. I will no longer watch you or buy your jerseys, hats, shoelaces, what have you. You players and coaches and the entire NFL MISSED THE POINT! To protest about police brutality towards blacks in America could be a valid debate. HOWEVER, to kneel during the National Anthem, which has NOTHING to do with police brutality and EVERYTHING to do with the fallen soldiers of this country and the AMERICAN FLAG, is a blatant disrespect to those soldiers, their families (who have a flag folded and given to them by the Honor Guard), the USA, but also to the FANS and millions of everyday AMERICANS who honor these things. You used the wrong format for your protest. You brought politics into a sport. Our one chance to get away from the political mess. You used your platform to trash Trump.

It's a cop out to say that the people who are against it really just want to beat up on blacks, women and gays with impunity.  While I'm sure there are a very small minority of people who feel that way, 95% of us are sick and tired of SJW's telling us how to feel and react to any situation full stop.  To trivialize it by saying we're all racists, bigots or fascists shows a total lack of understanding - which she continued to demonstrate through the rest of her rant on the subject.  It's clear she's not a real fan of the Doctor but used this simply to expound on her silly belief that many people actually mind in this day and age if women are put into positions of power."

I remember James Jackson traveled to NYC and used a sword to kill the first black man he saw. I remember 2 white men attacking a group of Muslims, and kidnapping and killing one. I remember vandals spraying hate graffiti on a black family's house and then attempting to burn them alive inside. I remember Steve Urbanski stabbing Richard Collins III to death.

You weren't troubled by the fraud of Trump University? How many good people lost money to that crooked scam? You weren't troubled by the fact that small construction firms report that Trump doesn't pay them and either files BKY or tells them ""see you in court""? You weren't troubled by the fact that he uses his power to leer at UNDERAGE girls? You weren't troubled by the fact that he was busted by the DOJ for illegally refusing to rent to black Americans or  steering them to his predominantly black building (aka racial segregation)? You voted for the modern day George Wallace. Save your ""respectfully"" because Trump voters obviously don't understand what respect means."
"Just how are""Christians "" in the United States being threatened? One can't count Dylan Roof's massacre because HE was looking for Blacks; the church members were a soft target as opposed to going into an inner city. The reality in America is that whether to refuse to supply services as public vendors to some people because they are not 'straight ' OR harassing Women going into a PP clinic ( not knowing that they might be getting something besides artificial birth control or an abortion), OR using doctored and illegally obtained media  aka Dalieden that inspires the  a 'Christian ' like Robert Dear to commit mass murder aka Domestic Terrorism, these so called  ""Christians"" attack EVERYONE ELSE.

We are ranked bottom third in education, transportation, and government transparency.  We are highest in taxes, cronyism, nepotism.  The middle class is disappearing on their 50 years watch.

As for shame, reasonable people don't expect cretins to have any which is why Mr. Bahr's letter is so perplexing. I suspect he doesn't have a sense of humor since Trump is obviously supremely ludicrous if in a ""sick humor"" sort of way. Let's face it, he makes all Americans look pretty stupid. But he really is a perfect fit for the Republican party, a sort of culmination of sorts of their years of smoking political crack. 
Are Republicans scary? Obviously.  White ghouls always are but instead of them getting a rope and wildly looking for a black man any black man, they're coalescing around a guy that's going to drive their party into the ground. Poetic justice is indeed gratifying."

"Indeed, if we look at the past, there's a lot of ugliness.  Sexism, misogany, sexually assaultive behavior (watch the Trump/BillyBush video for explanation), racism, violence against homosexuals, discrimination against physically and mentally handicapped individuals, mistreatment of the elderly....we can all add to the list.  Putting in the ""context of the time"" simply means acknowledging that it was widespread, not that it was morally right...Surely, no one would claim lynching a black man for ""looking at a white woman"" was morally justified just because it was accepted during the Jim Crow Era.  Surely, no one would claim a boss coercing sexual favors from an employee was OK just because it was rather commonly done.  Surely, no one would claim belittling the mentally handicapped was OK just because it was done on nearly every playground in the country.  

Some of our ""poster-community"" use the term ""politically correct"" to trivialize concern with behaviors.  (cont)"

"I am in fact old enough to remember when only white males were first class citizens. I was born in 1949. Throughout the 50s and 60s women and minorities were openly discriminated against in employment. Very few women held public office. Blacks were kept from voting throughout the south and were unable to buy housing in places like Eugene, Oregon. As late as the late 50s people as prominent as Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald could not get a hotel room in Eugene. (I recommend a trip to the Mims house near Skinner Butte if you think open racism was something that happened long ago and far away.) As for homosexuality, that was more likely to get you jail than matrimony."
"Boycotted Kaepernick? Surely you have some evidence to support that, right? And presumably you have some other evidence showing that this is about Trump, right?

Obviously his conduct is worth protesting and no doubt some players, coaches, etc are supporting their colleagues precisely because of Trump's inappropriate words and position. But at the heart of it this is about the treatment of blacks in America. Something Trump isn't addressing despite how it's starting him in the face. It's further evidence actually of how uninformed and out of touch he is with his own country.

Trump may be delivering the kind of bombast and empty rhetoric that his supporters expect and feed on but it's a far cry from how a President should be conducting himself. And the irony of you trying to call out others for lying is rich indeed when Trump's record of lies is so easily apparent. And you call others hypocrites. Unbelievable."
"i'm white and i'm not trying to be racist here, but maybe the reason police feel threatened more from black people is because they make up 13% of the population (in the usa) and 40% of the inmates in prisons and jails? not to mention the statistic that 58% of black males in prison are there because of violent crimes. having more black guys stand up against authority isn't going to give these young guys a great role model to look up to. instead they are showing that authority means nothing and you will find more youths standing up to police in negative ways causing more problems everywhere."
"According to Lisa and Dan, Trump can say anything he damn well pleases about Mexicans, Hispanics and Black people but Lisa and Dan draw the line at white women.

Now that there are no consequences for calling out Trump, our 2 ""brave"" Senators are finally ready to call out Trump. Lisa and Dan are some of the most cowardly and unprincipled politicians in the land. Republicans in Alaska deserve the cowards they keep voting for."
"Isn't it a good thing that millions who never voted before voted?  That is a good thing I think.  As for millions of blacks voting for Obama just because he is black is simplistic.   That is like saying millions of whites voted for the Donald just because he was a white bigot.   Yes there were those but many voted for him who were not bigoted.  

Fact is Obama was clearly the better candidate both times.  You really cannot say that about the Donald which will become more and more apparent as the Donald's insanity shines through. (Just like GW)"
"You had a better upbringing, or better chance at success than I. I think it's probably because of the NAACP, and not because your parents had the personal drive to go to college. You got to go to college, probably because you're black, while I did not - I don't have any afirmative action programs working for me, as you do.
In the history of this country, the privleged white man has mistreated Native Americans, Blacks, Chinese, Japanese, Gays, Women and I'm sure I've missed some. I fit two of those. Whaa! 
Enjoy your pity party Charles. I find it tiresome."
"Miss Ann Thrope, you will be amaze at the level of understanding, scholarship and knowledge we humans have on each other. You should read some more and read books that make you uncomfortable because they challenged your comfort zone. You are talking about African slaves that came in several decades after the founding of Jamestown. What you appears to forget is that the first blacks that was brought ashore came from a captured Spanish slave ship. English had no real history of black slavery before this so they took them in as indentured servants like many of the whites who there as well. Most of the initial  indentured blacks were freed later on. They form the core of free black Americans until the ending of the Civil War in 1865. Do you not know your nation's history, Miss. Thrope? Of course, it is important to understand that without black slavers, there cannot be black slavery in the United States.. Are you that blind to the obvious? Black slavers enabled white racism!!! Ironic??"
"So, I am Caucasian and grew up in African American neighborhoods. I have never met one person in my life that was teaching their children to hate anyone. They wanted the same things every other family in the area wanted. What you are doing, is using your racism to indict a whole group of people you know nothing about. Face it dude, you are a racist."
"Bill, I quantified exactly how much or how little BOTH white slaveholders and black slaveholders were complicit in slavery. It can be extrapolated from the 1830 Census, which was the basis of the article by Henry Louis Gates, quoting from G. Cater Woodson, that you linked to.

Black slaveholders, according to the census, owned fewer than  0.6% (I rounded up) of the 2.1 million slaves counted by the 1830 Census. Given that a couple of the ""civilized tribes"" owned about 10,000 slaves at various times I'm willing to  allow that 1% of the slave population was, conceivably, owned by then-despised groups, indigenous men and free men of color.

This means that 99% of American slaves counted in 1830 belonged to white folks. 

If you render these percentage in ratio, 99/1 and then convert the ratio itself back to percentages, the amount of white-owned slaves exceeded black-owned slaves by close to 9900% (since 100% of 1 =1). That's exactly how much or little each group was morally culpable."
"Angela Merkel, Golda Mier, Maggi Thatcher and Indira Ghandi managed to ring the bell. Why not Hillary? Oh yes, the US was not ready for a female President only a Black one. I must admit it must have been devastatingly humiliating to lose to Trump but who's fault was that........"
"As a retired old black man, I still remember the last good thing Republicans did for black people. It was in 1965.  Remember the Voting Rights Act? Current Republicans have gutted that Act. Since 1965 the GOP has set a pretty low bar for Democrats to cross to look less racist than Republicans. Every Republican president after Ike has used the Southern Strategy to get elected, appealing to white racists. That is why they have kicked off their campaigns by going to Philadelphia, Mississippi. Its other significance is being were Swerner, Goodman, and Cheney were lynched for registering black voters. The local white people love the attention. Democrats want us to vote. That is more than I can say for the majority of Republicans. Democrats are just the lesser of two evils. The GOP has become a white identity party in my opinion. Trump has been endorsed by Klansmen and Nazis. They brag that the GOP has brought them back into mainstream politics again."
"I can remember the rallies for JFK in urban black communities.  When is the last time you saw a campaign on foot in a poor black urban area by a white politician with a national profile?       

For that matter when did you last see a major politician visiting a small rural community in Oregon.  The only thing they did in Iowa was stick a weed stalk in their mouth and sit on a bale of hay for photographers.  *Oh, they did pay attention to corporate farmers, their crop subsidies and their tax offsets.    

Most Republican candidates  'equal rights' concerns, are often nothing more than protecting their own economic privilege.  I don't expect anymore than that, they general live up to my low expectation.

What hurts is Democratic lip service that has yet to transform these area's of great need.   They could try spending time in these homes, on these streets, talking with these families, but it's so much easier to make promises on TV or, send a check.

Sucks to be poor."
"Let's see ABC/ESPN (owned by Disney) broadcast the1946 Disney classic ""Song of the South"" and watch them all go crazy!  These PC idiots will let black people say anything they want with no consequence and get rid of shows like ""Last Man Standing"" that was the 2nd highest rated comedy ABC had for no reason.

ABC should just play shows from the 1950s and 1960s like ""Maverick"", ""77 Sunset Strip"", ""Cheyenne"", ""Hawaiian Eye"", ""Surfside Six"", ""Combat"" and ""The Gallant Men"".  These shows were the blockbusters that made ABC network as popular as NBC and CBS.  Now days, Dancing with the Stars and Bachelor/Bachelorette shows are the best mind numbing waste of time that only idiots watch are broadcast on ABC.  I spend my time watching YouTube's old documentaries from PBS and the BBC during prime time hours, if at all.

"I have to wonder which Hillary rat wrote that and submitted it to Kathleen to put out.  I will admit, its a smooth read and she's pretty good about being fair at the start but just like any sewer rat, she bares the teeth and finally can't help herself. 
I'm with the camp that says no body will be happy when this election is over. Hillary will get it, she has the money and more important these days, the manipulators that make it all happen in the back ground. This sex thing reminds me of the Kerry Swift boat ploy in Bush's second run. It was bs as this is but put it out and hammer it by a bought and paid for media and it will stick. 
Obama was hailed by many as the first black to be president, Hillary will be hailed by some as the first woman. Next we will have Jenner and only because the first two were duds. That should be fun when we have the ""first confused""  sharing the white house. 
What's makes this all so sad is the dumbing down of the people."
"Hey mom!  How many white guys are on the Pittsburgh penguins?  Shouldn't they be protesting against white cops shooting black people like other sports guys do too?!   Or do we have to wait till there's more white people shot?
  Mom!  Why does trump hate Obama so much?"
"I think if you were born black or a person of color, YOU'D UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.  If, you've spent ANY time in our urban cores, YOU'D UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.  If, you TRIED WALKING A MILE IN ANOTHER MAN'S SHOES, you'd understand completely.

Flag waving by Hatriotic Republicans makes me wanna PUKE.  You guys have lost your souls ... have ZERO respect for the social contract.  So the sentiment is likewise from my point of view.  All the flag waving in the universe ain't gonna change you guys are ugly to the core, not just skin deep."
Allie has a point for some there is hatred of military presence in Hawaii and some might be targeting them because of their race.  The murdered serviceman was African American.
"Hey Gerald, I literally posted the words of the guys that founded the KKK. Whatever crowdsourced knowledge you have of the subject means nothing compared to the people that founded it.

You can attempt to move goalposts or walk back what you said, or make it sound like we can't know what you know because reasons, but I have posted direct quotes by those that founded the KKK that refute your idea that it was a mostly anti-carpetbagger movement.

This is not about belief, you are making this an issue of personal choice. I will repost it so maybe you can understand....

"" Dressed up in scary costumes with hoods and masks, members rode about at night threatening and frightening blacks. They demanded that blacks either vote Democrat or not vote at all. They met defiance with beatings, whippings and sometimes murder. They burned blacks’ houses down and drove black farmers off their land....""

You assert they were not as racist as anti-northern. This refutes that. No more goalpost moving."
Maybe a major reason that Blacks viewed you suspiciously is the fruit of decades of progressives encouraging Blacks to look at Whites suspiciously.
"""Who has kept blacks in gang infested inter-cities,""

What a condescending, patronizing, elitist question."
"Exactly. Being Black is the ""race du jour""...if you're black, get out there and 'work your ticket'...opportunities abound!"
"How is it racist? Racist isn't even a very good word. I like race realist. Races are different, it's a fact. Nothing to do with ""hate"" or ""superiority"".
A minority population of about 7% commits most of the murders in Anchorage, that's a fact, and it happens to be the black race."
"You're tired of the ""race card""? Then how come you have to resort to that classic "" I'm not white"" race card? What have you got to be ashamed about that you feel the need to explicitly inject race into your description? The white supremists would love you as their ""snitch"" just as Nazis loved their Jewish snitches and the white cops love their black snitches. Just come right out and say you love the ""white rule"" and you kneel before them. Come on, cleanse your soul, it'll do you good."
"Lets all forget Hilary called black males ""super predators"" and call Trump's supports racist. I remember her being a racist when it suited her, but your right, my top end engineering education is to blame for my vote. Go stick something sharp up your rear end and sit down."

What about the poor whites living in vile, rotting trailer parks? They tend to vote Republican."
so the black cop who shot this guy was a full fledged member of this nationwide white supremacist assassination force you've mentioned?  reminds me of clayton bigsby.
Look who is calling the kettle black.
"Front page of today's RG: ""Fallout from the Halloween incident in which a University of Oregon law professor wore blackface has left many on the campus angry, befuddled and afraid.""

Why, aren't many on campus, especially women, ""angry, befuddled, and afraid"" of being physically assaulted, as a woman was in August by Torrodney Prevot, raped as in October 2015 by Brandon Austin, or punched in the face at Taylor's by 250 pound  Eddie Heard?

Why does the RG underplay these events... no names of the victims, no pictures (were victims white women?), no follow-up news on their injuries, no front page coverage, etc.? To the contrary, these assaults have been swept under the media rug as quickly as possible.

Where's the outrage from U of O's president regarding what appears to be a trend of black male athletes assaulting women at the U of O? What if they were white athletes assaulting black women?

University of Oregon's racism concerns appear prejudiced, unfair, and hypocritical."
"Because BLM was not founded as a black supremacy group.  They do not believe that they are a superior race, and there has never been any war where black people were trying to take over the world to reflect their image.  Equating BLM to White Nationalists is one of the dumbest things you could do, because by doing so, you are suggesting that the only thing White Nationalists want is equal treatment.  Which is not the case.  White Nationalists believe they are superior and that all other races and religions are inferior and should be eliminated.  In no way, does BLM or even AntiFa represent anywhere close to those views - and in fact, both are specificially against those views."
Give it up Black.  You keep talking about this phantom working class that appears to fit every news article that features a story of Alaska Natives.  I'll bet you haven't work all your life and now true hardworking people will have to subsidize you too.
"Bravo Sarah Kendzior, your words captured the essence of Trump’s shameful words and the struggle of Black Americans against racism and the violence perpetrated against them at the hands of police officers. Any progress made toward racial equality and justice stopped when Donald Trump won the Republican nomination for President. He, more than any other President, has sown racial division with hateful rhetoric and his reluctance to condemn white supremacists."
"Good point. White Supremacists, Nazis, and the White Nationalist and Supremacist branch of the Alt Right (not all of the Alt Right is racist) support Trump, but not every Trump supporter supports the racist views of these groups. A similar point applies to Black LIves Matter-- there may be members or supporters of that group who have racist views of whites, but not every supporter of Black Lives Matter is racist (for that matter, you see a lot of whites in the Black Lives Matter parade). Also, judging from the comments from politicians, not only liberals are opposed to racism-- conservatives are as well.  The Nazi's, KKK, and numerous white supremacist groups at the parade-- including some who attend these parades just to beat up protestors (like the ""White Fight Club"") are groups that very few people in the country support but events like this get them a lot of media exposure."
"There are conflicting accounts of the Spur incident, but what comes out clearly is the fact that
both White, and (majority) Black South Africans share this vexatious characteristic - VICTIMHOOD."
"Are you blaming American race based slavery on black folks? The ""underground railroad"" ended in Canada. You can't handle the truth about your heritage. Of course, being white you are the beneficiary of the white racism and accompanying violence needed for your privileges in American history. I should have not said history. The racist violence is still current events."
The only one who needs to fix his relationship with black America is Obama.  Blacks have little or nothing to show for progress and improvement during Obama's years as President.
"It must be tough to live in fear in your old age. Good thing you are white and live in Oregon. You could never hide here if you were black. Fortunately for me, the feds broke up the white nationalist group called the Order. They were the last folks to threaten my life directly. Of course, I never know how a frightened white cop may react near me. There is nothing I can do about that anyway, but stay calm and carry on. BTW, the racists I hate are the ones supported by government. Those are the white ones. The police have no problem killing the rest. The cops are generally less professional than the feds."
"No.  If a suspect is of color, it isn't either profiling or politically incorrectness to say so.  It would be both if someone were to say ""The suspect must be black."""
"How about this?

http://www.amren.com/news/2015/07/new-doj-statistics-on-race-and-violent-crime/

This table can be used for a number of interesting calculations. First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.

Interestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time."
Same I have met whites that have fled South Africa and don't like black people. Can't blame them.
"Blacks back on their knees and putting an X for a signature at the bottom of a legal document because they don’t teach handwriting anymore, why you ask? Democratic Party, the new social KKK. Democrats are race hustlers and they don’t discriminate."
"While there are small time bootleggers in places without bars or liquor stores in poor black communities, the end of alcohol prohibition ended violent gangs who based their existence on alcohol prohibition.  End drug prohibition and violence goes away.  Legalize prostitution and pimps go away.  Legalize abortion and back alley operators go away.  Lower cigarette taxes and smugglers go away.  Respect the principle of unanimity in legislating morality and you don't need a police state (assuming you quit using the state and landlords to keep blacks and hispanics in their place)."
"This whole so-called analysis is flawed and strongly raises questions about the author's very ability to divorce herself from racist notions ingrained into the very  fabric of America by whites. To suggest that any black person, Kaepernik aside, somehow  relinquishes the basic constitutional right to bring attention to the FACT of discrimination that takes the life of black citizens by that black person, regardless of his background, is itself the height of measurement by a ""double standard"". Moreover, this writer even strains her so-called analysis further by attempting to compare the NFL protest led by CK to the black community's criticism of Betsy DeVos...any one knows that this criticism is based on DeVos's widely held and inaccurate attacks on the public school system in favor of the old 'private school' scheme that his be used to prolong discrimination against blacks all over the country. Get a grip white people and don't be led around by the nose by the likes of 'Don the con'."
"Pete, you'll be delighted to know - there are no black people in that area."
"The difference this election was that white voters in the Rust Belt that voted for Obama or did not vote at all the last couple of elections, voted for Trump this time. Obama did save the auto industry and went thru hell and high water trying to convince them that he cared about them. I know quite a few white men that would never accept a female leader, much less a strong assertive woman. They have been hating Hillary for 30 years. Their wives stood by their men. Like the mother of a cop that may think the Black Lives Matter movement is a threat to their child, those Rust Belt mothers feared many things that might endanger their families, like the opiate epidemic in Appalachia that is effecting mainly rural white folks.  They feared Hillary didn't care about them because she cared about minorities. In their mind, caring when it comes to minorities in general and black folks in particular, is a zero sum game. Black folks gave Hillary well over 90% of their registered vote voters."
"Well if gay members (or others who are Prideful) cannot represent their employer like the TPS then maybe all employer groups and companies should be excluded......no banks, fire departments, air lines, no Kinsmen or Lions.... you get the drift.  Frankly BLM, as a social action and anti-violence movement, should be more concerned about black on black violence as their number one priority."
"This is such crap. This nation has not assured by any measure, much less to the greatest extent possible, that equality of opportunity for all Americans exists for black people. In fact quite the opposite is true and it is a matter of historical record. 
White America may not be able to atone for slavery, they have can atone for segregation and yet still have not done so, so please spare me, but more importantly those who are DAILY victimized by racism, the insulting homily, Mr. Loewy. White people wouldn't last a day walking in black people's shoes. 
""We must move forward""? Isn't that another way of saying we're still ignoring racism like we always have been?"
"I think that's a false assumption... The statistics just don't back it up.  So we are witnessing protests for a problem that does not exist.  We are humans and therefore unfortunate things can happen regardless of race.  But, the fact remains, if you do not break the law and cooperate with police, you will NOT get shot or otherwise mistreated... this idea that white cops hunt blacks for sport is just stupid and it destroys race relations as there are a lot of minorities that believe this now!"
"I have no problem when white and black folks dance in a circle when the Washington Redskins take on the Dallas Cowboys while others dance in a line or square. We are not mocking sacred dances as not all dances of Indians are sacred. Sometimes we dance just to be silly. 
No one has a problem when I refer to white and black people, but the second I say the word Chickasaw red, to distinguish I am not communist red, and by golly PC liberals always call me a red-neck troll using the word red as a slur. This ridiculous nonsense is teaching red people to be ashamed of our traditions and culture."
"This man is a coward & an oath breaker & the worst kind of human being imaginable because he incited & encouraged violence, blood shed & hatred over understanding, reason & logic.  

I blame him for his actions.  Not the BLM movement.  Not the police who killed the black men in LA, MN, or any other state.  Not the people who have been talking on social media.  No this is his fault.  I don't care how smart he may have been, he reacted stupidly & put people in danger.  

There's nothing to understand about why he committed these crimes.  It doesn't matter why because the answer is simple ""he believed he was right"". he wasn't.  If officials can't figure that out they aren't any smarter than the avg sheep. 

I believe in our country but we have to heal as a nation not fight as several.  We have to be willing to stand up for each other regardless of affiliation & connect with understanding & patience.  Not violence & protests. Cops don't write laws they're just doing a dangerous job."
"""Time honored..."" yup, let's honor the all-white male membership clubs - you Black or woman? Sorry, you're not welcome except in the kitchen. That's the history of golf, no matter how hard you try to embellish it."

"Not until black Americans  and even black Canadians are prepared to admit, and do something about the destructive forces they create with in their own communities, with drugs, weapons,  violence, fatherless children,  rejection of education, and racist hatred for other  people,  little will change.  Blaming Trump is just a way to divert attention and responsibility. You could blame Obama just easily but won;t."

I find this sentence unsettling. What if it said ""The Blacks were unreasonable"" or ""The Whites were unreasonable"". Would that be okay?"

"Trump said during the election, Chicago has been thoroughly democrat for 30 years: sheriff, mayor, police chief, school boards, and most of the public services are Democrat / black controlled. Despite all the wailing of mothers when their babies are shot, they do nothing.

"This country has been a giant affirmative action program for folks that Europe didn't need or want, for 200 years. Most white folks don't know what they have earned based on merit, or what they got for just showing up white. A meritocracy will not be kind to the poorly educated white folks that elected Trump. BTW, the easiest way for those European refugees to become white was to learn to fear and hate non-white minorities in general and black folks in particular."
"I was just noticing all those knock-off blacks for Trump signs.
 
Those signs are printed out to make it look like they are hand-painted but the give-away is the amateurish error in judgement that printing so many that all look exactly alike makes it apparent they are not hand painted, they are knock-offs.

The other problem with all those knock offs are the white hands holding them up.

If Trump discovers how clumsy his set decorators are, he'd likely fire them.

It doesn't make him look like he has black support, it makes him look weak."
Am I the only one disturbed by the fact that the 'face' of this KPMG scandal is suddenly black?
"Why is it that you know nothing about what is going on in the native Hawaiian community?  Did you ever hear about Koho Pono, the Native Hawaiian voter education campaign that have distributed thousands of legislative report cards in Hawaiian communities and online? probably not.

Have you ever seen the Maoli Arts Month initiative started by Hawaiians to help Native Hawaiian artists achieve economic self-sufficiency? doubtful.  I can go on and on. Your flippant attitude about a cartoon that cost Disney millions of dollars and an endless amount of its resources to make is the same attitude of other white people who say that ""All lives matter"" in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. Your smug ignorance keeps you ill informed and irresponsible. enough already. Your ""extremist hatred"" comes through loud n clear"
"Do you THINK before you speak? Do you have a CLUE? DC - Hillary won 85% - all black votes. California - LONG known as a liberal haven - should be broke up and Electoral votes handed out by percent of votes to each candidate.  North East - more liberals than you can shake a stick at. New York - liberal and ignorant... 'Current' numbers have Hillary ahead in Popular vote by less than 50K votes - a joke at best... The Democrats tried hard to rig the campaign - do it every year, do NOT want to have people prove they are citizens - do some checking instead of crying... P.S. Thanks for showing everyone posting here that YOU are a bigot and the 'racist'!"
"I hearing talking and more talking all of the time from our elected officials, but their actions are all together different.

Bottom line they are racial racists and I have no time for the agenda nor their disrespect for our flag."
"Dude will have his day in court.  All the mainland PIs and defense attorneys aren't going to help.  Don't lay that black defense here.  That doesn't fly on the rock.  Remember Christopher Deedy?

"""White Privilege"" is a made-up term used by Leftists and post modern neo-Marxists.  Two weeks ago, no one heard anything about the black man who opened fire in a Tennessee church-- where did ADN report that?  For how long?  Yeah, look at all 8 of the comments.

It's now said his attackers were racially motivated, leaving a note referencing Dylan Roof (who we all know, and who is WHITE).

"This is a non starter, if it was someone else they would spent time in jail, but this American where money and the 1% count. He will walk away with a smile on his face.

I understand the history Jefferson davis.  but would somebody please tell me what the hail Obama did for blacks except stoke more racism. .  Even Louis farrakhan in his constant praise for Obama states basically Obama didn't didn't do grass digested  by a cow !!!! but the reason he didn't do anything is because there's nothing to do.  blacka just like everybody else in this country are not living under Jefferson davis law.
I suspect that black folks are about be told again by a bunch of old white guys -- the biggest complainers in the world relative to their status -- to stop complaining.
Obama most certainly did court BLM and the Black power movement through BOTH campaigns.
"So tell me, were black ghettos in the US any different? Were they allowed to live in white neighbourhoods in the South? Nope. Were the Chinese in North America allowed to live with white folks in the early 20th century? Nope.

 And here is a Dutch joke - what is the most famous Dutch word? Apartheid. Does that need any elaboration?"
Don't you think the Republican party lights up with delight to have a black person to bash and satisfy their base?  its been tough on them not having Obama to run against.  Sooo hard to be accountable.   This sad story is shameful but the Republicans are going to drag it out..... because it fits their schtick.

Fire bombing a republican headquarters and now they are spreading racial hatred and threating to kill an American who happens to be black. 

""In the message, which Utah Republican Party Chairman James Evans has become the target of racist and threatening calls, he played for The Salt Lake Tribune, the caller said: ""You might want to tell that lying n----- James Evans that he's lucky he's not being lynched right now."" [Salt Lake Tribune]"
Promoting blacks in the HPD is brutalizing? How so? You against affirmative action for some reason?
"Richard is spot on. Why is diversity so wonderful? One would not think it so wonderful if one is jumped on by a gang of ""diverse"" folks, which is more likely than not to be people of color of some kind, since we have one of the largest ""diverse"" populations per capita in the U.S. Having a job that once took me into the Cook Inlet pre-trial facility was an eye opening experience. Yes, there were plenty of angry white disgusting individuals, but was easily and predominantly populated by angry, black,brown and native disgusting individuals. But, in my experience, I have to note, not having seen one, not one, prisoner of oriental persuasion, aka, Japanese, Chinese or Korean. (Yes, one can tell them apart). Consequently, if I had a choice as to which race I would prefer to share a cell with, if I was a felon, I would overwhelmingly choose one of oriental descent or possibly Jewish, if one could be found, which isn't likely, therefore, I would have a safe, quiet cell all to myself."
"GC:  Sorry, you are just running scared.  The Professional Plaintiffs like linda hamilton,  have you living in FEAR.   I have rentals and I have a NO policy on dogs, cats, lizards, snakes, chickens,  whatever.   I have had people provide a side insurance policy covering any damages from animals and this works fine.   Also, a NO policy on Homosexuals,  Cigarette smokers,  POT HEADS, DRUGGIES, Lesbians, she/he's, he/she's, Trans-mutilated, poor credit, criminal record.  I only rent to MARRIED heterosexual BLACK, WHITE, MEXICAN, people of other colors,  Elderly, who qualify.  I have never been sued and I rarely have a vacancy."
"Be careful what you wish for. It takes only one corrupt white police officer to mow down a young African American male, looking suspiciously ..... black.  Now image a society where only the police officers are allowed to have guns. That scares me more than any deranged gunman in Vegas. It is too much power to avoid eventual oppression of the masses.  And it will likely begin with the least powerful among us. So  begrudgingly, I will keep my gun and pray that I will never need it."
"... who did you vote for Pres?  ""Grab 'em by the p**sy"" ... likely with support of the Russians!

Thanks for proving our point!!  Republicans have ZERO moral compass, only CLAIMS to it.  Rubber ain't hitting the ground AT ALL with Republicans!!!

All you guys do now is boot lick the rich ... drive up the deficit, that only matters when a black man is in office.  Lol ... we're back to 'deficits don't matter' fantasy land."
"Before jumping to conclusions, do some research on Ian Eisenberg and Omari Tahir-Garrett, both of whom have colorful histories. Eisenberg has a long history of what might be called sleazy capitalist stunts (i.e. ripping off people). He's the stereotypical money-grubbing Jew.

Omari has long represented the black community as an outspoken activist and Seattle School Board candidate. He earned notoriety when he clobbered Mayor Paul Schell with a bullhorn, something I think Omari deserves a gold medal for.

In the meantime, stop using that stupid, meaningless word ""anti-semitism."" When I ran for Governor last year, the first work in my Voters Pamphlet statement was ""Jewarchy.""  Google it."
"My guess(educated)... the young black man/men sometimes have trouble assimilating into the island way of things. A gang banger won't get much respect on the street from local types especially south pacific islanders with the same skin tone. I'm thinking the young black man was disrespected recently, and was forced to retreat because numbers were not on his side. He returns to the scene, with an AR, and randomly fires into a crowd, most of which probably had nothing to do with the shooter's current mood. Typical behavior of an east coast city cretin. Cowardly weasel move. Some people should not be allowed to breed."
"NFL = disrespectful, mostly black men airing their contempt for the USA by kneeling during our National Anthem. Personally, I stand for the flag but kneel for the cross."
"And conveniently (but not surprisingly) NASCAR is all white, no pesky blacks to upset the fans."
"Isn't it amazing that all this bs started when a partially black muslim foreigner took over Our White House.  One of the worse things he did (in my opinion, and there were many) was trade 5 (?) ISIS members for 1 U.S. traitor so the ISIS members could continue the war on America.  Reading what some of these people say and do amazes me.  Talk about dumb and dumber.  Not holding my breath but still waiting to see how long it's going to take to open a full investigation into bummer and hellary's uranium deal."
"yep, they just hated that the black guy and the Democrats passed something."
"This sickening beating is definitely a hate crime and since the victim is mentally disabled, he was kidnapped. Whoever is involved sure need to be charged with attempted murder, and from what the article said, yes the perpetrators were black. It doesn't matter what color skin we have or what race we belong to, a beating is a beating and a hate crime is a hate crime."
"Granny Mao's plans are coming down. Obama is now exposed, and to save the legacy of the first black POTUS, Hillary will be sacrificed!"
"""an extradition treaty would commit Canada to transferring fugitive Chinese officials to a country known for biased courts and harsh interrogation methods – and where the death penalty can be imposed even for non-violent crimes.""
Translation:  Canada aspires to become a safe haven for any and all criminals from any country we don't like, depending on the flavour of government we have in Ottawa.
But if 'prejudicial treatment' is such a big no-no, why are we extraditing anybody to the US? They have the death penalty, they use 'harsh interrogation methods', operate 'black sites' commit extrajudicial killings, still they snap their fingers and we jump.
Hypocrisy is at its best."
"RD is trying very hard to justify his support of discrimination. Of course, if one says that the station of blacks is to be subordinate to whites, then the Jim Crow laws are perfectly justified.

So just what is the ""duties"" of gays, RD?"
"What has Trump done to help black people?

You can't accuse the Clintons unless your guy beats them.  So please share what he's done that's so much better."
"Yes we should be free to criticize Robert Mugabe, and I would be one of the first to do so, but that criticism should be based on his appalling record not the fact that he is black."
"Did they get a permit to terrorize a black church the night before to the point where the members were afraid to leave? A mob had formed of white supremacist carrying torches yelling ""blood and soil"" and white rules or something of that sort.  After a half hour?  The multinational church members had to be escorted out the side doors into alleys and they left for home.  The whole time they were in fear of being physically assaulted.  Trump said he waited to be informed?  If Fox didn't report it then djt didn't know about it, trust me.  So you can say whatever you want......make this about political parties.......or fake news or whatever the hell you want cherry picker but.BUT: djt is a racist and is giving credibility to those frothing at the mouth like the mad dogs they are..............and over what?  the color of skin.  

 This isn't about parties honey.  Not by a long shot."
"When people go to sporting events , they do so to leave every day life behind . That's why all politicians get booed when they are announced at games . Kaepernick is a spoiled punk for disrespecting the flag. The 49 er's owners are spineless to let him get away with it. Many thousands died for our freedom . They would turn in their graves if they saw what disrespectful people some have become . These punks have cheapened this ultimate sacrifice .  Westboro members deserve our scorn for what they do .  As do the KKK and Black Lives Matters. Local high school players deserve taxpayers scorn for taking a knee at the field they provide for them. The pathetic part is that liberals who support Kaepernick forget that he also said Hillary Clinton should be in jail for what she did while explaining his disrespect of police."
"The irony is stunning.
99% of the posters think BLM has no business making themselves heard. 

This from a society where your largest minority has to appeal to the United Nations to have their human rights respected by their own government.

Where hate crimes against minorities are committed at a rate twice as high as in the U.S.

Where the group making up only 4% of the general population makes up 25% of the prison population, a rate far in excess of blacks in the U.S.

Where kids are killing themselves by overdosing on drugs at a rate twice the murder rate of NY.

The only reason to have this post deleted or even give thumbs down is because you don't like reading it."
"I replied to all the nonsense in your Slate post.  I am not real crazy about Josh Marquis, overall, but I agree with his position quoted in Slate.  Here is a re-print of my response in case you missed it.

""I have to agree with most of the decisions and positions of those prosecutors cited in the article.
The US Supreme Court has upheld our Jury system numerous times and our death penalty standards as well.
The number of convicted black people is pretty much equal to the number of black people committing the crimes. And most of those crimes are against other black people, from drive-bys where six year old girls are killed, multiple murders and assaults outside strip joints and gang fights over drugs and prostitution. to just cover this year's Portland crime scene."""
"So in this case, ""compromise"" means liberty for the baker, not for the customer. In other words, as I said, liberty for me, not for thee.

Given that the baker's idea of ""religious liberty"" means ""the liberty to discriminate against gays""; I would say that the Christian religion, which does NOT say ""love your neighbor, unless that neighbor is LGBT"", would call on him to serve the customer.

I believe that to practice arbitrary discrimination is a far greater sin than being homosexual. I see no difference whatsoever between a baker who would not bake for blacks and one who would not bake for gays. Both are perverting the Christian religion by claiming that their ""religious liberty"" would be damaged by doing so. Both bakers are bigots, ""justifying"" their bigotry in the name of religion."
"Comparing LGBTQ rights to what blacks went through 60 years ago is way beyond laughable. Please show me a LGBTQ public water-fountain, restaurant table, bus seat, playground equipment and so on."
"BLM is reacting to the belief that black lives do not matter. Saying ""all lives matter"" is simply a white person's way of blowing them off -- which is racist."
"So, it's quite obvious that we should treat people according to their skin colour, in the absence of DNA testing which can confirm ones victimhood status. The other lesson for the children is to be very careful when you interact with black people lest you accidentally offend. It might be safest to just stay away."
"It does not see class but it does see a race, its a white problem. I am getting so tired of this ""epidemic"" turning into an all american problem when thats not the case. 78% of users are white and that number is probably in the mid 80% currently. 3% are black and the rest of that percentage is divided amongst Hispanics and Native Americans. You all refused to acknowledge the white crack users in the 80's, crack his wall street just as hard as it did the black community but black people became the face of drugs. There is a refusal to take personal responsibility and everyone including the government is pacifying and coddling these white junkies. They should be treated just like the black users did in the 80's. Stop pulling everyone into an issue that is only hitting the white community hard."
"It is black people that experience this kind of structural violence on a daily basis because of the many failures of our government.

Then change your government.."
"“Black” market means what exactly?

Clandestine? Illegal? 

So then “black” people? What does that mean?

So that’s my point."
"No, if you want to start counting starting at 9-11, it's Muslims by a wide margin.

And if you want to define ""terrorism"" as murder, your accusation that whites are the worst doesn't stand.  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, blacks are only 13% of the population, but black offenders committed 52 per cent of homicides recorded in the data between 1980 and 2008."
"Clearly you don't understand the use of examples .   The American flag is supposed to be something we can all take pride in and despite our differences on issues--the flag brought us all together .  Football games were meant to let us escape our daily lives for a few hours and enjoy time together---again--despite the differences we may share.  Then these over priced punks decided they wanted to invade our time with this miss-guided nonsense .  Kappernick clearly got what he deserves--as will the NFL if they don't stop using games to push they're issues.  Will you support my right to use the N word to the same level you support these players rights to disrespect America ?   As for All in the Family , I never liked that show .  Look how far we have come since then--electing a black president .  Now rich blacks want to move us backwards. What a shame ."
"If you were a Black woman, you likely would be ""obsessively pejorative"" about Caucasian people -- especially if you were an 'academic' or ' government employee' ...... but there you are --  you have proven that 'bigotry and racism' is a Human issue...

. . . and by the way -- you haven't expressed an opinion on 'mixed marriage' yet..

Surely, with your attitude, you must see an issue of 'privilege' with a 'mixed race African/European' marriage.. and what of the children, jane…? .. what side of this, hmmm... what did you call this again... oh , yes -- ""debate"" does the issue of children from a mixed race marriage fall into?..

 . . . what say you, jane on this so-called issue of 'privilege for mixed race children'...???"
"what blows my mind is how black slaves adopted the religion of white European slave owners, and abandoned their African American religion/culture. As the son of a Native American I have been baffled by members of my family who adopted Christianity that tried to genocide Native Americans."
"Except Bill Clinton and the black guy................. 
.............. who individually left office with approvals higher than Bush and Trump combined"
"I agree Alexandra,

Our leaders know they are wrong in treating women differently. It is just like white owners and their black slaves, those in power don't want to give up their power over others, even though they know it is evil and extremely harmful to continue the abuse.  They fight this change with all their might because they know, once they do give up this power, they will never get it back again."
"Kind of like white males were silent after Dylan Roof shot those black people? We should have taken out full page ads denouncing those of us (I'm a white male) who have decided to go on a holy war against minorities, yet we didn't.

Shame on us."
"""It is hard to see the Trump Presidency as anything other than a direct repudiation of the racial rapprochement, and comity, that the previous election of Barack Obama once promised.

I fail to see anything but complete failure on Obama's part to fulfill the promise referred to. What I saw was the rise of BLM and a spike in the temperature of the racial conversation. I believe the black community at large and its well respected leaders across America also failed, miserably, by not standing up and demanding more from Obama.

America voted for change. Real change. Not a repeat of failure by Hillary and Bill and Barack. And if the black community wants to share in that change they should be working with Trump vs. the ridiculous references to the KKK which hold as much water as a resurgence of the Black Panthers or the SLA.

Lastly, I worry about the state of education is this is the level of insight and knowledge being delivered."
"Yeah, that's it. 

That's why they handcuffed him and left him in the middle of the road because, ""they were concerned for his safety"". 

Just admit it, this is just another story of a trigger happy cop, who is probably more then a little racist, shooting an unarmed black man."
Prog:   I don't hear protests about black on black violence.   But that's none of my business (takes sip of Chardonnay).
"Americans have been doing that themselves now for decades, but Obama and his minions, including Hillary, have certainly revived the racism...just by opening their continually prompter fed flapping gums. How dare blacks NOT vote for him...HE says!"
"Ah, poor white guy.

I am white and it has been great. It is like I am a V.I.P. citizen.

Why don't you write a book telling black people how to protest?
I bet that would go over al ost as well as your cable tv idea.

Triggered snowflakes melting all over."
Here's a history guestion for you... the first person in America went to court and won his case to own slaves???Both are black..... so you started slavery.... get off my back

Our apathy about you has nothing to do with your race (assuming you are actually black). There are many other reasons to not care about you.
"If only American blacks could achieve the near nirvana afforded those blacks in Canada who , according to the UN, are up against racism so horrendous that it's considered 'normal' by the Canadian white majority with racism rampant in every public instituion. But don't let that stop you from taking the moral high road."
"You do understand that ""protesting"" as you put it, is protected speech under the Constitution, right?  If you don't like black folks, or them speaking out makes you uncomfortable, or whatever, that is your baggage, not a legal or criminal issue."
"EE: Indeed, ""racism"" is not a crime...it is not illegal.  When it becomes manifested in actions which discriminate  or cause others to fear for their personal safety, it may, indeed, ""become"" a crime.  

We saw millions of racists come ""out from the shadows"" when President Obama was elected.  Suddenly, it because ""fashionable"" to post racist comments on the internet...entire websites were created just for such posts....Indeed, it is protected ""free speech.""  Disgusting, deplorable, dispicable perhaps, but certainly protected free speech.  Sure, it's legal for folks to wear 'blackface"" and mock AfricanAmericans.  Sure, it's legal for kids to tell Latino kids ""hey, get ready to be deported""...""hey, pack your bag.""  Indeed, with the election of Donald Trump and with the racist and xenophobic comments he made during his campaign, we will now see increased ""license"" to emulate those comments.  Racism is ""alive and well"" in America today.  I find that very, very sad......Gary Crum"
"Where did they claim they were?  I've always wondered by whites/white supremacist hate black/brown people.  Let's take apartheid south africa and the U.S., for example.  Who has more reason to hate whom? Despite what has been done to them -and still continue to be done to them- black people still 'love' white people.  Even as they suffered the horrors/torture/indignities of slavery, they were still loving their masters; loving, taking care of protecting their children (including wet nursing) even as the massas sold off their own, sometimes ones they themselves fathered.  Slaves went into the civil war with these masters to take care of them, died taking care of them even though these masters were fighting to keep them as 3/4 a person.  Ignorance really is bliss, isnt it?"
"CDC and the FBI Census Bureau. 
Police killings of blacks down 70 percent in last 50 years
In 2012, 123 blacks were killed by police with a gun
In 2012, 326 whites were killed with a gun

In 2013, blacks committed 5,375 murders
In 2013, whites committed 4,396 murders
Whites are  77.7% of the population blacks are 13 percent

“Anyone, anyone, thinking clearly can see that the homicide rate among blacks is way out of proportion, thus the police intrusion into black precincts, since, in a whopping 90 percent of black homicides, the dead person is another black, or the offender himself.”"
"Jemele Hill is a racist. Always has been, always will be. However, since she's a black woman, her liberal company would never dare suspend her in the current political climate. Had she been a white male and said something like that about the last President, she would have been promptly fired and branded an evil racist that should never be hired again. Hill (and her co-host) ruined SportsCenter. The ratings are in the toilet, down 20% from last year. It used to be ""This is SportCenter"" and now it's ""Yo Yo homeboy, dis be SC6 Y'all"". I wonder why people stopped watching?"
"The Progressive Marxists HATE America. 

Most can't run their own lives but prostilitize they can run a country. Since Andrew Jackson... Voted to keep Slavery (not ONE republican had a slave) Voted against Desegregation. Created the KKK. Votes for Slavery today (look at their cities Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago...) Votes for Genocide -Planned Parenthood)- they HATE blacks, kill their babies. Created Jim Crowe laws. Vote for Illegal Immigration. Loves AntiFa and BLM and their thuggery. Loves Political Correctness - Marx... Divide and Conquer. Espouse Saul Alinsky.... ""speak to power""... Marxist Against the Wall Against LEGAL immigration FOR Socialized medicine. For higher taxes. For massive Muslim immigration For OPEN BORDERS Sanctuary Cities HIGHER TAXES NO ACCOUNTABILITY of ANYKIND 

Progressive? ReGRESSIVES rather...."
Thats why there are so many participants at black lives matter riots during the middle of the work day.
"People once chose to believe ""black"" humans were property. They minimized it in their minds to conceal and deal with the legal crime of their time."
"""Officers will be required to use their own observation to determine a person’s race....""
Wonderful!   If you are not obviously white, black, or Asian you'll automatically be labeled Mexican.
But, then again Springfield police automatically assume anyone with brown skin is only capable of speaking Spanish."
Sure he condemned it after creating the conditions with his so-called justice dept doing ZERO. If black lives matter was called white lives matter and cops were dying at rallies what would he be sayin and doing then?
"Paul Ryan is WAY out of line.  BLM and Antifa are hate groups just like the Neo Nazis and KKK.  In fact, BLM and Antifa are actually worse now since they are actively calling for the murder of whites and some in their group are rioting and killing whites (especially cops) while the KKK and Neo Nazis have not called for the murder of blacks but only the promotion of white society.  The Neo Nazis and KKK are condemned because of their past practices 50+ years ago.  BLM and Antifa are condemned because of their current practices for the past 8 years.  You can't fight only one side of hate.  Both sides must be fought so show fairness, justice and equality by our law enforcement and government in the eyes of the people.  For Ryan to condemn one side only and not the other, shows him to be just another establishment politician who's more concerned with his image and getting re-elected than he is about maintaining law and order and the security of the American people."
"I like African spirituals too.  Grew up in New Orleans just a few blocks from a Black Baptist church and a would often bike over just to hear the music.  But there is nothing more ridiculous than a Catholic church full of white people ""diggin' it"" and trying so hard to look cool and ""diverse"" by singing old Black spirituals.  It's not that it's ""cultural appropriation,"" it's that it's just plain ridiculous.  White people can't even clap right to their music."
"In Canada , maybe.  In US state prisons, an average of FIVE times more blacks than whites; in some states, close to 10 times more black convicts.  

Just sayin'."
and where did the father go? I'm willing to bet he flew the koop like many black men in his situation
"Black Lives Matter is ok, because, Blacks have suffered racism in America for well over 400yrs even today ""Covert"" ""Overt"" and subtle racism is still prevalent, not all whites but racist whites at many levels in society use many social inequalities to keep people of color in a constant state of perpetual poverty, anything from covert housing discrimination, to school discrimination, high arrest rates, high unemployment, targeted credit and financial services and unequal distribution of income or wealth. These types of social inequality are the reason that BLM exist, Contrast: White Lives Matter, this dangerous twisted concept is rooted in the notion that it isn't Conservative white people who are the actual racists; rather, it is black Americans and those others who dare to talk about white privilege and white supremacy that are guilty of that sin."
"Where were there CEO 's the last 8+ years when militant blacks, Hispanic/Latinos, Muslims, homosexuals and ILLEGALS were rioting in our streets threading whites and our children with death simply for being white? Not a peep from corporate America, the Leftist so called, ""Mainstream Media, nor the Regressive Socialist Democrats! Obama and his corrupt crew were doing everything in their power including hiding their instigation of violence and hate and no one called them out on it. All these actions by reservists is simply revealing to America their globalist mind think."
"Such as murdering and maiming people by running your car into the crowd, or promoting hatred against Jews, or just being part of a terrorist organization like the KKK with a long history of murdering Black People? You're talking nonsense. Fighting back against right-wing hate is not Left-wing hate and intolerance, it's standing up for what's right."
"Maybe they're busy holding marches for all the murdered black people in Chicago.

Oh wait, they don't care about them."
"That doesn't address the question of why so many black, completely unarmed suspects, suspects running away, and so on, are shot, except in terms of a lack of training and professionalism by the police. Police, who are supposed to be equipped to deal with dangerous situations, confess to being scared to death. They are especially scared of black people, which could perhaps be excused on the part of an untrained lay person. Do you think military police and members of the clandestine services respond to danger by emptying their weapons into the subject? I don't think 5% is a very impressive number. But it's about the money. Police mostly handle routine social scut work and most are not really emotionally and physically trained to the level necessary to deal with dangerous situations, and policing is not even in the top ten of dangerous occupations. The public simply doesn't want to assume the cost of training police to the level it would take. And, no, I'm not going to swap studies."
"WHEN, precisely, Did ""blackface"" become ""a historically offensive stereotype""? And why?
If a black person put on ""whiteface"" and donned a blond wig, it wouldn't offend me in the least."
"""America is way more divided now than when he was first elected."" GBA! - You're kidding, right?  America was always divided.  Obama's election and the rabid reaction to it by the Republican leadership just encouraged racists who'd been closeted by law and shame to ""come out"" again.  Black Privilege?  What a stupid thing to say.
Music?  Can't say I like rap.  Encouraging violence and sexism isn't the best use of the arts in my opinion.  But the incredible flap created by white people over Elvis Presley shaking his hips on national TV doesn't speak well of mainstream reactions to the daring and different.
No matter what intentions Obama had as a human and a politician when taking office the obstructionist freak show of the Republican Party made it publicly clear they wouldn't work with him.  His politics had nothing to do with it.  The GOP and it's corporate owners live in deadly fear of the day when Americans finally wake back up and recognize our real ""enemy within""."
"Yes, and if you're black and walk into a restaurant and they say ""we don't want to serve you, get out,"" you should just leave and find a place that will serve you. Simple, just like the south in the 1950s."
"I never suggested that, and I think that's the core of the problem here.

Of course white people and black people can be born into varying degrees of opportunity. Of course anyone can slide in either direction on the socioeconomic ladder. 

We do have a society that is much more fair than it used to be, but we aren't out of the weeds.

To pretend that blacks and whites over the generations have had the same opportunities handed to them is a total fallacy. All you need to do is listen to the experience of others and try to understand them. 

I'm not trying to argue we void personal responsibility. I'm not suggesting we tip the scales in the other direction (affirmative action is a racist policy). And I'm certainly not suggesting that only white people can be racist. But to say that all black people who are in poverty are only there because of choices they made, or to pretend that racism against whites has the same impact as racism against blacks is harmful and ignorant."
"Thanks. I will watch it. Doe's that prove the ""state sponsored violence""? In summary, how did FW do it? Did he pay black people to kill their brothers?"
"News Flash: Cops target Blacks and Latinos for drug arrests at far higher rates than Whites! OMG,  who knew?"
"Actually, Joe, what they stated was not racist.

What you stated was.

They were making a comparison, whereas you were fully buying into the racist agenda of the Black Lives Matter rhetoric, which is racist.

Black lives do indeed matter, just as any individual of any other ""group"" matters.

How about this, Joe?

ALL individual lives matter, no matter their demographic, as those of your own ilk, define them?

I am sick of racists and bigots such as our own Government, sick of racists such as the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement, and sick of racists and bigots such as yourself.

Why?

Because all they, and you, concentrate upon is the demographic that an individual belongs unto, within theirs, and your own view, rather than simply the individual, AS an individual, themselves

They, and you, Joe, disregard and disrespect the individual, because of your own racist, bigoted, and misogynist ideology.

But you just keep on keeping on.

But you cannot justify it.

Ever. ."
"Awww, I thought we were having a conversation about race, I didn't know saying black was now taboo.  It gets a little warm and you get uncomfortable?  Grow up and have the conversation instead of hiding behind racism to mask your hypocrisy.  You made a statement about the anthem, expect a reply or don't post."
"I dont get it.  To date, all Israeli Jews; black/brown/white/Sephardi/Ashkenazi share a single space with separation between the sexes.  What rationale is there to demand being different and have a separate section for anyone or anything?"
"But, boy, those black guys, can they ever run and play basketball..."
"Because immigration laws are rules of exclusion, and progressives go crazy when you mention any exclusion (except ""black safe zones"" or black-only student centers) or any rule that runs in favor of traditional America.  They would even tolerate Sharia law here, because it goes against the American grain.  Anything that goes against the American grain, they like."
"The fact that he and BHO have personal/professional ties, and also that they may have met prior to Watson rendering his terribly prejudiced decision should make him ""faulty"" and his decision should be nullified.  This is similar to what former POTUS Clinton did talking to AG prior to HRDs email scandal.  Watson is a damn fool if he had discussed this matter with his buddy BHO (black panther, extremist muslim operative).  So sorry folks the show should end here.  CONSPIRACY written all over his decision!!!"
"GBA:  If Charles is about our age (70-75) and lived his life as a black man in America, he has experienced a very, very different America than did you and I.  Would it do you any harm to acknowledge that.  He, I'm sure, could tell you anecdotes of institutional discrimination and personal discrimination and racial insults he experienced over his life.  Would it do you any harm to muster just a little empathy for him.  From all I gather, he's a very bright, competent man who succeeded in life through a) his talents, b) his perserverence and c) his ability to, somehow, tolerate the mistreatment he received and ""bounce back"".  Today, I think his attitude reflects all those experiences he's had...just as our lives reflect our experiences.  Does he sound angry? Yes, indeed, he does.  I don't know about you, but, I'm guessing if I had received the treatment Mr. Dalton has received because he's Black over his lifetime, I'd be on very angry man myself.  BTW: why are you so nasty and angry?"
"Actually it isn't and your opinion is obvious by your attitude. Media continuously bring up race when there's no proof race was a factor and go viral with stories specifically in which a black guy is shot by cops and never vice-versa. That's why these cops getting acquitted, and oddly it's not causing you to rethink your position. Nearly all interracial homicide is black on white, yet you're silent. So spare me your moral blinders."
"No, irrational racist hatred for our first black president divided this nation."
"Looking:  Ya, ""Drop the block all together"", Lets just let the Police decide when they pull you over.   Dispatch, Vehicle Stop, Uhhhhhh, driver is Ummmmm, female, No, male, Opppps, he/she, she/he, Cough, wait a second, Trans-Mutilated, maybe Agender, I know for sure they are not Black or  Mexican, Wait, the driver says to look on their Drivers License and  in the sex box its marked with a ""X"".   H ^ & *, I do not know.  I am calling in for backup, I need to go see the Psychiatrist."
"“We’ll always have the situation where people won’t see us as total people. Sometimes they just see us as football players,”  When the president publicly calls you an SOB It's not because he just sees you as a football player ""disrespecting"" the flag or America or whatever - he sees a black man asserting himself and that's clearly not tolerable in Trump's new Jim Crow America. I'm pretty sure it's unprecedented for a president to use such hateful and foul language directed at specific Americans in a public speech. Maybe short of Jefferson's notion of “The blacks...are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind,"" Jackson calling Indians savages, Polk's hatred of ""mongrel"" Mexicans, Wilson calling the KKK ""great"", Roosevelt's Japanese internment order, ....uhh never mind."
"Trouble is your thinking that merely because white Americans voted for a black man they can't be racist.   Racism exists on a spectrum from those that can't stand to even see a person of color exist, to those that tolerate their existence as long they they stay in their place. Voting for Obama doesn't prove you aren't racist any more than hiring a filipino to cut your lawn or a black to clean your house, or play NFL football.

But voting to elect an openly blatant racist to be president is in and of itself a racist act.   Own it."
"Germany does NOT have statues celebrating the Nazi Party, the genocide of Jews and other racial, ethnic and cultural groups and promoting the maintenance and revival of racism.  You can acknowledge and study the dark chapters of your history without celebrating them.....there is a very important difference.  I fully understand that the Civil War is part of our history.  I fully understand that slavery is part of our history.  I fully understand that racism is part of our history......and, unfortunately still part of our ""present.""  Some of the statues in question were erected to celebrate racism and the Jim Crow era and created in the early 20th century; others were erected in opposition to the Civil Rights Movement......in both eras, they were clear manifestations of racism designed to intimidate Black Americans.  Those wish to retain them overwhelmingly support that same racism.  Gary Crum"
Trump is back in Houston. Another do-over to masquerade as a descent human being. I saw him lift and 'air kiss' a small black child. He can't even fake empathy.
"I think most Republicans still support Trump, but it must not be a very happy experience for them. The Republican party is in a way a fake party, cobbled together mostly by a common hatred of a black president but otherwise not able to work together. Their steadfast inability and unwillingness to appeal to Latino voters will cause more and more problems for them going forward."
"I understand the DM narrative is that all farmers is racist - even a small dairy farmer in the Swiss Alps. But please
"" it has been unable to protect them from neighbourhood racists."" Without balanced reporting this may just be someone enforcing a legal right to water, water reticulation or land legally purchased.
Example.
We bought a water right from our local scheme for a few R100,000. But we do allow some of the community to collect water and wash laundry in the canal. These people live on a plot owned by a black man - and he does not provide any water for all the tenants, but collects the rent. Yes the fountain belongs to the people (viva communism), but only some of the people maintains the infrastructure to get the water 3km closer. We can charge them money, because we are racist farmers you know. But we do not."
"I was comparing the African culture of the 18th century with  that of American culture of the same time period.   No, I do not assume all black people are genetically pre-disposed to tribal violence.   It is however what has been going on in much of Africa for eons.    There are some areas in Africa that have gotten away from it, but it is still common."
"As the first member of my family to ever graduate from high school and who attended undergraduate education on the GI Bill or while in the service and worked part or full-time for my entire college time, I have absolutely no sympathy for your whining.

There are too many successful black people in the world who are your color and age and some even became multi-millionaires.  Dr. Ben Carson is one who comes immediately to mind.  Were you from a single mother in the Detroit projects like he was?  

The black General officers who are also your age and did their duty and excelled instead of whining are other examples.

I was at Duck U in the 60's and 70's;  Four (4) women were in the law school with me; where were you?  

Somewhere whining that failure is not your fault because your forbears were still slaves in 1864?

My family believed in that old motto; ""Root, hog; or die!""  

Nothing is given; you have to work and earn it.

I don't give my name in part because of racists like you."
"You remind me of a guy who used to call himself ""Proud Surrey"" at the National Post.  (He was also known as ""Proudly Surly"".)  Your claim misses out on right-wing violence in Europe, burnings of black churches, economic violence (which I imagine you don't believe in) as perpetuated by the Chicago School, the occasional murder of a doctor who provides abortions, and the fact that in North America, there is little for the right to protest; they are largely running the show.
The car-burning crowd generally consists of the Black Bloc thugs, who are anarchists, not leftists.  The overwhelming majority of people involved in recent protests have behaved well.  I know -- I've been in some."
"How long did take you to find that quote, copy and paste it into your comment? So weak when you can use reasoning to make a comprehensive and cogent argument to support your position. However, it is not black or white with me and others who don't panic at he mention of global warming an the coming apocalypse. It is with the AGW alarmists that position themselves that it is so cut and dried that anyone who doesn't buy into that whole idea must be in denial. The climate models have been virtually 100% wrong in predicting all of the disasters so that the climate change advocates must make up fake numbers and rig the results in order to ""prove"" that they are right. It might almost be funny if I weren't so pathetic."
But they should if they are going to imprison black men. It's their RIGHT! How dare they even incarcerate a black man!
"Black person: Sesssion's bankrupted the KKK in his prosecution of them in Alabama
Brown person:  I don't know anything that he did for brown people (and I don't really know what a brown person is; it sounds like you might be racist)
Female:  Equal rights for years
Gay person: Marriage equality, despite democrats coming late to the party.
Muslim: Same rights as everyone else"
"CUE:  ""As far as my ""10"", YOU have brought this up 4 times now. I understand about being JEALOUS, YOU are not alone.""  ...  where to start...? i have probably mentioned your ""10 incher"" more than 4 times. It's the most humorous and outrageous statement i've read in a newspaper comment section. watch Shrek again and take note of the ""compensation"" remark   i figure you seen it , being a cartoon and all.
   i don't enjoy responding to your posts, i feel like i'm taking advantage of a child in many ways.   
  i've come to realize you really have no idea how to actually communicate with others -  your go- to response is always something nasty .. often unrelated to anything. what you think are slickly ""hidden and coded ""  in your posts are well known, degrading  terms regarding blacks, women, gays ""druggies"", etc . terms an insecure person would use to feel better about themselves. the fact that you throw them in totally unrelated places is just desperate.  i do feel bad for you"
"By ""jobs,"" Trump voters meant ""jobs for white men"". They did not want family leave to help women, a path to citizenship for Hispanics, legal protection for LGBT, travel for Muslim workers, or help for Black Lives Matter.  It doesn't matter if Trump keeps his promises, or even if he actively contradicts himself: Trump voters know that whatever he does, Trump will put white men first. They elected him, not for any policy, but to protect them from having a woman, another black man, or a white person who sympathizes with the marginalized in the White House."
"That was the first thing i thought when i saw the headline. I'm trying to remember the last time i saw a headline that read ""extremist black kills white person."" Bellows, meet flame."
"One of the many reasons that people have protested Mr. Trump is the terrible choices in his cabinet.  For instance, in an example of ignorance so remarkable that it seems impossible, Ms. DeVos remarked that historically black colleges were established for school choice, and not because institutional racism prevented black students from attending other colleges.  The prideful and willful ignorance of Ms. DeVos - obvious during her incredible confirmation hearings - isn't recognized by Mr. Trump because he also knows nothing.

The entire administration is a hot mess."
"As a 10 year old I marched with MLK with my parents. They did not give us guns for protection either. You had to be very brave to face white cops with  dogs and such. They kill black people that try to defend themselves. How many of the folks you helped kill were actually a danger to us and how many just had stuff the government wanted you to steal, like oil? I spent 13 years as a vocational counselor and helped 13,000 Lane county citizens find work and better their lives. I was paid less than the average mill workers of the time. I worked with at risk youth, welfare moms, ex-offenders, and displaced workers. I was also a founding board member for Wellspring Friends School, an alternative school that the public schools that were not serving those students well. I could go on but I know you don't care about my humanitarian successes. Why do you resent people that got college educations and worked for the good of the community? What do think an UO education is worth?"
"Because existing as a black president is ""race baiting""....
Get real."
And if it was a bunch of white girls doing that to a black girl....
"Precedent Dotard's attacks on black athletes who choose to kneel instead of stand during the national anthem in protest of racial inequality and police brutality inadvertently prompted more awareness to the cause as more people began taking a knee.
Like, Meghan Linsey, a country singer who took a knee in protest at the Titans-Seahawks game earlier this week after performing the Star-Spangled Banner.
It was a bold move for a country singer to show solidarity with African-Americans who have endured injustices.
Since she took a knee, death threats poured in but she says she has no regrets, even though she received hate mail from ‘people' telling her she was anti-military and they hoped she would get cancer.
Yep.
Trump supporters showing their 'true colors'.
Supremacist terrorists are all they are."
"Could all this critical talk of him be racially motivated?
The well mannered Senator (Meridith) is being forced out because he was black and the female was a young white girl. Is that racially motivated? 
Start the spin process as of now!"
Speaking to Black leaders and Hispanic students (you don't qualify the women you talk to); why would you exclude white Caucasians of either sex from your conversations? Would it not be considered to be biased by the SPLC to limit your interactions to racial minorities?
"It would be interesting to see how many blacks died in greater Chicago 
 from shootings since the Las Vegas massacre.I would bet Chicago won this race."
"Not so much as a syllable is deleted from history books about the disastrous Civil War for Slavery and White Supremacy when a statue or plaque exulting a Civil War general or politician is removed.

Don't confuse history with statues. There were no statues in post WW2 Germany venerating Nazi War participants and that didn't stop accurate history from being written. 

Holocaust denialists are anti-Semites who are making up alternative facts. They deny based on their anti-Semitism and extremist propaganda, not due to the fact that they aren't sure what real history is since their are no heroic Nazi statues in Germany. In fact, imagine what those anti-Semites would do with a country full of statues and plaques celebrating Nazis? All you have to do is look at this thread and across the internet to find Americans still to this day celebrating the atrocious, tyrannical, anti-black, anti-liberty traitors from the Civil War. America needs to stop celebrating white supremacy. Enough."
"Funny how multi millionaire sportsmen are on this bandwagon, while literally thousands of Black Americans are being gunned down by other Black Americans compared to a few shot by police - the supposed root of this protest. Seems like not all life is sacred. It just depends on who shoots you. Beats me."
"This issue is ultimately about legally creating a third gender or class of human beings. Males, Females and Transgender-gay. Federal signs concretizing this law for bathrooms have already been created. The man, the woman (skirt) and the transgender half-skirt. This illusion has been achieved by making gender synonymous with race. Gay equals black-brown or the minority of your choice-they are the same legal identity-victims of oppression. Gays/transgender are now allegedly a race of people. Therefore as a legal recognized race of people they are liberally entitled to special privileges and Laws protecting them-special financing-affirmative action-job preference and so on. I personally do not believe sex or sexual identity should be elevated to the level of race. I have no issues with anyone's sexual proclivities, identities or desires. The same laws protect all of us. I prefer that we are all Americans and not hyphenated-Americans. 
There is nothing exceptional about sexual identity."
"Do you live in a cave?  If you don't understand the legacy of slavery and the continued disadvantage of black and brown minorities, then​ nothing I can add will be of value."
"Of course it was about protecting the institution of slavery!  ""States' rights"" concerned the right to keep humans in perpetual bondage, to buy and sell them, to torture and rape them.

Not framed in those terms.  Southern politicians claimed that holding blacks as slaves created conditions for all members of their society, including the slaves, superior to the inequities and strife of northern and European society.  But the large body of slave narratives shows this lie for what it was.  See, for instance, Frederick Douglass' autobiography, or Solomon Northrup's TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE, lately adapted into a movie.

If you doubt southern motives as they existed before the Civil War, please have a look at speeches by leaders of  the southern states before their secession.  You can find some of those speeches at http://www.confederatepastpresent.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=41&Itemid=54&limitstart=10 .  ""States' rights"" is post-war whitewashing."
"Ivanka's sad story

First ""they"" took away the Latinos. And I was ok with that. 

Then ""they"" took away the ""iner city blacks"". And I was double ok with that. 

Then ""they"" took away the muslims, even the ones who served out armed forces. And I was super ok with that. 

But then ""they"" threatened people I sort of affiliate with. and that kind of bothered me. 

Oh. And by ""they"" I mean the hired goons what support my Daddy."
"Like all pro illegal immigrant orgs, the bishops refuse to say just how many illegal immigrants America should take in every year.

And the bishops also fail to mention that it used to be African Americans who held the jobs that illegal immigrants have taken.    This loss of employment has had a huge effect on Black culture in the U.S., and for the worse.    Nope, no mention of that in their bromides about the value of family.

What a coincidence that the majority of illegals are Catholic or come from a Catholic culture.   Not a coincidence really.   The bishops are just putting parochial issues over that of America's best interests, and quoting the bible to try to give it moral weight."
"Yup, cause black men never deal with stereo types about having too many children."
"I am 65 years old and of mixed racial heritage. Even on the reservation we called criminals thugs. No blacks lived on the reservation back then. 
I now live in Alaska for 44 years, we call bums who steal, beat up people, and make threats to little old ladies THUGS. THUGS come in all colors, shapes, and sizes. 
Thugs are bullies, they are usually not very smart and depend on their muscles not brains to get them through life. 
Ruffians, hooligans, and vandals were names that my grandparents called the neighborhood THUGS.  Villains and gangsters were 70's words for THUGS.
These days people throw around ""RACIST"" so much that they take away from what a real racist is. A THUG can be a racist and a RACIST can be a THUG. 
Look at it this way, in the US we call a bathroom by many terms, latrines, toilet, head, powder room, bathroom, restroom, crapper, out-house. In England and other former British colonies, they call them water closets, loos, John's, lavatory, the Ladies and the Gentleman's."
"""Whether it is against blacks, Mexican's, Muslim's, women, LGBT or whomever...our country has continued to demonstrate hatred"".

Perhaps you might give several counties you think have a better record. And for the record, you can skip the Scandinavian countries, they have their share of similar problems that don't always make the news."
"214.  The United States is a murderous country, or don't you know about Pulse Orlando nightclub in Orlando, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook Elementary School, Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen, McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro,University of Texas Tower in Austin, Columbine High School, Fort Hood in Texas.  What about the shooting of black men in the United States? You tell us about Chinese  and Cuban human rights. Better still tell that to Trump and his friends at the NRA."
"Like Mike Brown? The maority of police shootings have been justified. Not all, but so many that calling them all murders and pointing the wrong fingers does nothing to realize the situation 

The problem isn't why so many young blacks are getting shot by police, but why are so many young blacks engaging in crime.  And in the clear case of Michael Brown, violently resisting arrest?  Michael Brown tried to kill a cop and has been martyred by the black community. This in itself is divisive."
If you gave a speech and nobody listened did you really say anything?  If people march down the street and you turn your back on them did they show you anything?  I can think of so many ways to confront these pot bellied bozos that does not involve violence.  Time to channel Mahatma Gandhi and not the lunatics like Black Lives Matter or Antifa!
"In 1992 a black guy painted the N-word across the front of my house.  I had a black roommate, a Ryerson student and the guy was his classmate in sociology..  When I called the police, they accused me of doing it and threatened me with arrest.  The guy was forced to apologise to for his hate  crime , but he said :"" You white people have no sense of humour"".

The problem is that it happens all the time and nobody is willing to admit it."
"What exactly are you appalled about? Afghanistan's Taliban government  provided material support for Al Qaeda to invade the US and to kill thousands of people in New York. The Taliban was breaching every human rights law on the planet at the time (you may recall the Taliban blowing up ancient Buddhist statues and stoning women to death in football stadiums). What exactly is it about Afghanistan in 2001 that inspired your better democratic modern sensibilities? Or are you a fan or proponent of austere medieval religious death cults ruling countries. 

Afghanistan deserved to be invaded. Iraq did not. This was Bush's mistake. And Canada, as a signatory to Article 5 of NATO, had to join the US invasion of Afghanistan. It is a requirement under the mutual defence provisions of NATO's Charter. The problem with Afghanistan is that it is hopelessly mired in the ancient superstition of Islam. It will take hundreds of years to shed this black death cult."
those white Republicans just can't stand anything good that a black man does.
"""That Harvard study shows that police treat people equally and that there isn't evidence of racial bias against minorities.""

No, it does not say that. It actually says the opposite. 
""On non-lethal uses of force, blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to experience some form of force in interactions with police. Adding controls that account for important context and civilian behavior reduces, but cannot fully explain, these disparities."""
"I totally agree w/you.  I don't know, truthfully, that much about radical Islam terrorism but I do know racism when I smell its stink.  My Father is so racist he can't watch sports anymore.  THAT's so frightening to me.  To hate simply because of color.   On a show I've already linked to, a former African American NYPD Detective said that Blacks were treated better when white people owned them a chattel.  He got very emotional talking about NYPD now and the problems of racism w/in ranks.........nationwide."
".....so, when is the BLM community of West Indies ancestry going to do the same for the LGBT community? You *are* aware of course that the Black community has a long standing hate for Gay men, and that being gay can mean a death sentence in countries like Jamaica or Trinidad? In fact we have many refugees from these very countries who fled on threat of death because they were gay.  When will this ""major cultural shift"" happen? When will BLM ""recognize, own and apologize""?

(Of the 77 countries where being gay is illegal, 33 of them are in Africa, 10 of them are in the Caribbean - you've got some apologizing to do)"
"Your understanding of the law has a long way to go before it catches up to my kindergarten age grandchild. Hate crime has zero to do with murder or the substantive crime committed. Instead, it has everything to do with the miscreant's motive. Blacks could kill every white person on the planet, and as long as the crimes were motivated by something other than hate of the victim for being a member of a legally protected class of people, it will not be a hate crime. A call to arms: All Republicans get your GED; it's free."
"The irony is that Kim Jong Orange and his merry band of soulless GOP buddies are trying to kick their own supporters square in the jimmy. 


One wonders if those supporters will EVER wake up to the con? They are so blinded by their hatred of the incredibly competent woman and the guy who dared to run the country well while black that they cannot see they are getting suckered, over and over, to vote for the cons."
"Not all of those first crimes are violent. The US incarcerates more of its citizens than any other country in the world. We are the world's jailer. Prison rates in the US are the world's highest, at 724 people per 100,000. 

The  ""for profit""  Prison Industrial Complex is one of the fastest growing industries in the USA. It's profitable to keep people in prison. Many are imprisoned for low level drug related crimes as a result of the nation's war on drugs.

Our drug laws are set up to discriminate: ""Federal law stipulates five years’ imprisonment without possibility of parole for possession of 5 grams of crack or 3.5 ounces of heroin, and 10 years for possession of less than 2 ounces of rock-cocaine or crack. A sentence of 5 years for cocaine powder requires possession of 500 grams – 100 times more than the quantity of rock cocaine for the same sentence. Most of those who use cocaine powder are white, middle-class or rich people, while mostly Blacks and Latinos use rock cocaine."
"There are dozens of s**tholes like Chicago, Camden, Kansas City, Atlanta, Oakland, Pittsburgh, and Miami with extremely high murder rates.  In every case more than 90% are committed by non-whites. Why don’t you hear Obama giving speeches about black communities policing themselves and taking responsibility for the crime, drugs and murder in their neighborhoods? He has no problem with proclamations about white people clinging to their guns in middle America where there are virtually no murders in comparison these Democrat run, kill zones...with the toughest gun laws in place.

The entire gun narrative peddled by leftists is false. The crime rate has been falling for 25 years. There were 24,703 murders in 1991 when the population was 253 million. Murders in 2014 totaled 14,249 with a population of 317 million. The willfully ignorant American public completely buys the falsehoods presented by Obama and believes murders and crime are skyrocketing.  Unfortunately, truth=racism nowadays."
"That is my concern too but I was adressing the comment that the person worries about his white son succeeding in his academic program. Further, when a person graduates with a Ph.D I certainly don't believe that a white male is at more of a disadvantage than a black female Muslim for example."
"Is this guy for real?
.
All was 'peaches and cream' in the Muslim world before the Europeans did .. what exactly - invented 'racism'? And 'Muslim identity'?
.
Does he know how non-black Muslims refer to black Muslims? 'Abd', Abeed - isn't that 'sl.ave(s)' in Arabic! 
.
What happened to non-Muslims in these areas, after the onset of the religion, throughout the years?
.
Or, why is there a special 'treatment' for K.a.f.i.r.s? Why were non-Muslim taxed exorbitant amounts? Why is/was non-Muslim human deemed dispensable in the Muslim culture?
.
And so on.
.
To write an article like this one, one has to be either 'an useful id.iot' or a willing tool of political Islam."
"We all know your kind of racist:  ""I can't be racist, some of my best friends are (fill in the blank)""  Oh and you two guys are so close that you regularly keep in touch with him and his family, you share all your racist posts with him, you are godfather to his children, you worship at the same church.  I am impressed however that you had a military co worker who was African American.   And wow, no one knows what a subordinate really thinks of them.  You are delusional to think otherwise.  When you are in a position of authority, you are in a power position over them, they can't tell you what they really think.  ESPECIALLY IN THE MILITARY.    The truth hurts when you're exposed, Sukiyucky.  I clearly struck one of your racist nerves.  BTW, I've been sending yours and some other posts from the SA to some African American friends to show them how racist the white people are in Hawaii.  It's been fun."
"""so this was a case where the black guy got himself shot""

Ah, so it's entirely the innocent (black) victim's fault that he's dead.  Just an accident.  Nothing to see here.  Move along."
"Of course the media won't. If the perpetrators are not white and the victim is not black. You forgot to mention Media24, with Max du Preez the latest example of hypocrisy and cowardice hiding behind censorship of comments.

His attack on AfriForum and then closing the comments section so that those he attack cannot respond. These same liberals claim to fight for freedom of media and speech and claim to ""open the debate"" about racism, yet censor all comments. 

As for Sparrow. The latest interpretation by the courts regarding hate speech is that it should also incite harm. She was stupid yes but her comments never incited violence or harm against any group. And nobody mentions that nothing came of Khumalo who DID incite violence by stating that people should do to whites what Hitler did to the Jews.

At least here on DM they had opened the comments section again so that the public can exercise their right to comment, react or defend themselves.

Most liberal journalists are Sycophants."
"It's called "" EMPATHY "" of the rabid hateful leftist kind. 
This is the face of the neo alt left in Canada. 
Anonymous black clad thugs beating on Canadians in the streets.
Where is the condemnation from the PM?"
"Strange, no one out on the street protesting the shooting as would be the case of a black victim."
BLM was started when a Hispanic shot a Black?  Are Hispanics one of the peoples of color?
"When is the protests against black violence? It maims, kills and terrorizes infinitely more blacks then anything else."
"No one is making excuses for Nazi', the fact that a bunch of Facists (antifa-the ultimate oxymoron) and Black lives mater (a Black Racist organization) feel they have the right to beat people up and the media plus democratic politicians give them a pass and even praise them or invite them to the White House is a false narrative that Charlotte is being used to perpetrate. That misdirection if not called out is a much bigger event than even a KKK rally. A KKK rally is a non-event if left alone. Everyone knows who they are and what they believe, they talk to themselves for a couple hours and go home. Antifa and BLM go out looking to cause trouble to further their radical cause, intimidate people and stifle free speech. They are the real threat we face today."
"I will keep saying there is nothing in the bible that says so called Christians can't bake cakes, gays can't marry or insist so called Christians should discriminate. These Bible literalist, literally can't find one passage that they can use to defend their actions. They conveniently ignore passages that cover all kinds equal sin's that is what makes this whole thing baloney. Mean while, here is the deal we live in a secular nation, annd this man can practice his religion all he wants but he cannot discriminate. Where does it end, no cakes for muslims? Blacks? Latinos? No, it is going backwards."
A big part of the problem is that liberals view these men or boys as victims not criminals. That was obvious when Obama repeatedly blamed the police in all the confrontations involving black men.
"The terrorist group BLM represents the black community today- they have allowed that, with the help of George Soros, this President, and his Justice Department. Another dark footnote in this nation's history.  Single mothers make up over 70% of black households.  Black on black murders and blacks currently incarcerated infinitely exceed other races.  Any time someone asks what the black community is doing about this, they are deemed a ""racist"" by Leftists and made to apologize.  The ""safe Space"", ""Micro-aggression"" crowd wins again- and we all lose."
"If the demands of Ndifuna Ukwazi don't make sense, it's because they don't make sense. This organization is an ANC front, serving a dual agenda: - 1) embarrass the DA administration of the W. Cape (which is open to embarrassment because of its socialist agenda + futile efforts to persuade black voters in the province) and 2) appease the Muslims in Cape Town by frustrating the efforts of a Jewish educational institution willing to pay top dollar for a property in Sea Point to operate as a school and cultural centre.

Whatever efforts the City makes towards affordable housing will never satisfy the agenda of the venomous Ndifuna Ukwazi. Best treat them as the facists that they are."
"Peter if I may reply to your post, do you know why black people will always vote ANC ? Even if you see them as liars. It is because there is running water, access to education if you work hard, electricity, food in the shops. It has done it's best in the present environment, worldwide comparing as well, this is a very young democracy, we cannot expect American government, that democracy has been in existence for 100's of years. They are doing fine, and the white monopoly capital in this country is racist as the narrative is that "" blacks cant do anything."" It's quite sad, why all this vitriol all of a sudden. The ANC are not liars, they have done very well to service 54 million people fairly, the National Party only serviced not even a quarter of that in 1994."
You hit the nail on the head with your concluding sentence.  To me her ignoring the important black leaders in the room is a far more egregious lack of decorum than putting her feet on the sofa.
"It also adds a layer of irony, that black Toronto folks were targeted in a study on black Toronto folks about targeting black Toronto folks to reveal to the country: ""targeted black Toronto folks"".

I am not surprised that the study was also done by black Toronto Folks."
"Not what my Sheikh says.  And he's black himself.  That whole ""black Americans cannot be racist"" slogan has been pretty much discredited."

LOL !
Give me a break.
At the very least... go back to the mainland, Delaware or where ever."
"You use black people as a shield.
You use black people to hide behind and defend yourself.

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate. But, you know what they say. In the long run, we'll all be dead. You can hide from the truth if you wish, but the truth is that the Republican Party is now the party of racism and racists."
"Did Clinton refuse to rent apartments to Black people?
Did Clinton pay a settlement for racial discrimination like Trump did?"
"No, the past is not 'the past', because racism has been perpetuated from generation to generation of those whites who stereotype those with darker skin."
"Yes diversity is great, but it needs to win on its own merit not be allotted winning slots for being black. There are great black and Asian actors, but they all can't win and can't cry too white when they lose- do they want merit or tokenism ? Whites are the majority and Blacks only 13 %  afterall -Viola Davis is magnificent and won on merit-she leads by example not gimme gimme.  The handful of non-Blacks in the  NBA don't complain."
"No black, Muslim or  visible minority person in canada has ever been accused of,  charged with, and much less convicted of a hate crime . So of course it seems like hate crimes are out of control in Canada: white people are not allowed the same legal recourse as non white Canadians no matter how blatant the racism they may have faced.  Perhaps race hate crime stats would be different if everybody had the same rights."
"both plane and yourself. the problem is that its not black and white, cut and dried. the words are, but dogs will be dogs. the most highly trained dogs can be as dumb as we humans."
"Observer - truth hurts all right. I'm sorry you live in a state so far away from the KKK. Sounds like you missed an opportunity to join the hate you spew. Comments like that endear black people to people like people like you. 

Obviously not all black people hate white people. Which is clearly proven everywhere you look when you see millions of Black people marrying Black people. Where do you think mixed children come from?"
"Peddling white privilege is now an is a favorite tactic of the left based on creating and exploiting white guilt to get privileges for minorities.  It is the latest indoctrination program for freshman entering university.  The worse example occurred recently.   Black students should be offered free tuition and housing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison because blacks were legally barred from education during slavery and university remains out of reach for black students today, the student government said Wednesday.   Oh really?  There have been asides for 30+ years  for Blacks in admissions to both undergraduate and graduate schools in almost all universities including the Ivy Leagues even when grades and SATS scores are less than white applicants.  Several Ivy League universities even put limits on orientals admissions as  a policy - only because they are better prepared and academically disciplined if the truth were said.  This movie is just peddling more race identity politics."
"Is it any wonder? 

http://www.amren.com/news/2015/07/new-doj-statistics-on-race-and-violent-crime/

This table can be used for a number of interesting calculations. First, we find that during the 2012/2013 period, blacks committed an average of 560,600 violent crimes against whites, whereas whites committed only 99,403 such crimes against blacks. This means blacks were the attackers in 84.9 percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites. This figure is consistent with reports from 2008, the last year DOJ released similar statistics. Perhaps not coincidentally, that was the year Mr. Obama was elected president.

Interestingly, we find that violent interracial crime involving blacks and Hispanics occurs in almost exactly the same proportions as black/white crime: Blacks are the attackers 82.5 percent of the time, while Hispanics are attackers only 17.5 percent of the time."
"Well, I have seen the shirt on a couple of my black friends but never on one of my Hispanic or white ones, so I'll just leave it at that.  

It's sort of like years ago, one of the black Platoon Sergeant's I knew was aghast to discover that one of our officers had wound up in Oakland at about 11:30 pm in a soft-top civilian Jeep and survived the visit.   

His response""  ""Man! Black people don't be on the street at that time of night in Oakland!""  He wasn't reluctant to use the ""N-word"" regarding some of his ethnic persuasion when he thought they deserved it.  

That was a constant in the military.  The lazy, the intentionally incompetent, the slackers on sick call; the 'real' black soldiers threw the ""N-word"" on them regularly.  We honkies couldn't use it, but they certainly did.  

 Different cultures are just different cultures."
"Minorities commit as much crime as poor whites? Citation needed. Blacks specifically commit an insanely disproportionate amount of violent crime. 

This is the most apologetic story I could find on the subject but even they had to admit reality. The numbers don't lie, reals over feels.

https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-black-americans-commit-crime"
Sounds like you preferred a black apologist president with an Iranian born Muslim senior advisor?
"For 2 months my email box filled daily letting me know you put a gold star on my posts, and on over half of my posts you replied positively and added to the debate. You even stated you wished I could be more liberal with my comments toned down for this board. Then you learned I smoke pot and now you're posting crap like this, even when you're in agreement with what I said. Does your bigotry towards pot know no shame or dignity? You're now acting like the racist who agrees with me, until he learns I'm Native American and then starts treating me like I am black. Your dysfunctional behavior is quite curious to me, and especially from a man of your age."
With all of the problems with the Black Lives Matter idiots even the radicalized Muslims any positive police.public interactions is always a positive event.  I went to a Trump for President fundraiser in Mpls last arch and talked to many BLM protesters their protesting a black guy getting killed by an officer.  There idea of protesting involved laying on a highway or the light rail train tracks which only pissed people of when they were delayed and missed appointments or work.  They looked at me like I was crazy and hassled many people when they tried to leave.  I then wrote letters to both the Mpls and St. Paul police federations asking then to meet with the residents of that community and get to know the residents and help them get ride of the gang bangers and drug dealers and end the senseless shootings and get positive publicity.  If they could go 3 months with no incidents then the MN Vikings would send some players and also pay for a community Barbecue to celebrate their victory.
"It is common for white racists to call black folks racist. It is projection on their part. Their bizzaro universe validates them. They are clear that they think facts and logic are liberal conspiracies. The sad truth is that the most valuable asset that GBA has is his white skin. It is logical that he would defend whiteness at every turn. He has nothing else to lean on. Unfortunately, his fellow travelers have made a point of arming every white racist in the country. Just in case."
"Your comment is nonsensical.  And political correctness aside there are some things that are simply correct.
If you can't divide 15 by 5 is the problem that Math is racist or could the problem lie with government run education systems.  Is it a lie that 15 divided by 5 is 3 or is it that it was discovered and documented by white people to equal 3 and there is actually a better black or brown answer? 
The politically correct truth is that the left doesn't believe minorities are capable of learning math and that is the soft bigotry of low expectations. 
I repeat the real bigots in the issue are the public schools, their unions and the idiots like Gutierrez who make excuses for them by blaming everything on institutional white racism."
His cult members should be proud that he's finally better  than the black guy at something!
"You're so cute and funny.

The gay couple isn't likely to burn a cross on your lawn and string you up.  In fact they just want a cake. 

I would guess a lot of racist folks have had their houses painted by black and mexican guys.

So yeah, you hire a house painting crew, they aren't go to runaway when they see your bumper stickers, unless they feel in danger. 

While you are at it, make sure the guy working the drive through is the same race as you are. 

Does this cake guy think he's going to be hurt by making a cake for a gay couple? Is he going to loose his soul?  We better check out scripture on that one."
"Drive to any major city in the U.S. You'll see lots of white and black people standing on corners begging for money.  Then go into any business.  The people who are cleaning your hotel room and serving you at restaurants are Hispanic. White and black people could do these jobs too.  They just refuse to do them.  So trump and his brand of racism is just completely out of touch.  If we kick out all the illegal immigrants, the orange crop won't get picked!"
"Amazing how so many are outraged by what the church did in support of their beliefs, but they turn a blind eye when Black Lives matters will only allow people of color to some events. When liberals shout down and attack those who think differently than they do. When the MSM refuses to address the issue of FGM in the Muslim community here in America but they will put this article front page. (How many will even bother to google FGM and the affect it has on women, were is their right to chose?)

The hypocrisy is rich here."
"I think they meant Philadelphia, which is not ""first-world"" for those of us who aren't white. 

On the other hand, it's interesting to see how forced-birthers use this Black rhetoric but do nothing to help living, breathing Black babies, women, or...really much anyone. The forced-birther's hypocrisy in general is galling, but around Black lives and Black bodies it's just shameless."
"Wayne,  how about supporting black criminals instead of the police,  supporting the Sharpton group who does nothing for the black community,  pushing Obamacare down the throats of 67% of the American people against their wishes, and on and on and on"
When feeling threatened? So if someone just came up and punch you in the face and doesnt have a weapon that you would shoot him? Why not punch hin back? I get it if dude cones at you with a knife. That's a serious tbreat. Zimmerman or whatever that dude in florida namw is said he was threatened because of couple black teens with hoodie. Would you shoot someone if you felt threatned like that? Interseted in seeing your response to my question
"As Ronald Raygun said, facts are stupid things.

There's not any evidence that three million non-citizens voted in the election.  There is evidence that the Republican Party conspired to kick off actual citizens from voting rolls if they were perceived likely to be ""voting while black.""

It's an old, tired, nasty tactic for crooks to deny everything and make counter accusation.  Make America Hate Again seems to be the plan."
"Exactly: more gun laws will not solve a cultural problem. Blacks are shooting each other and others not because of the existence of guns, but because they are caught up in a culture of gangsterism. In the UK, where guns are harder to get, they instead attack each other with knives and machetes, often in epic street battles in London. 

Most black youth go to school 'tooled up' and are quick to use knives in any dispute. This is the source of the violence and bloodshed."
"I guess you didn't notice the perp here is white. YOU are the one who brought up black people. You are obsessed with race, aren't you?"
"Oh you see every plane.  Maybe you would care to state your position at the airport  that allows you full disclosure and test samples of all cargo and fuel loaded into planes.  It's no wonder they moved you from bag chucker to  chief of secret airport police  conspiracy investigation unit.  And your condescending racist remarks are not appreciated.  I mean because the black community doesn't have any conspiracies  like aids infected immunizations  in Africa and black communities here in the US.  Like how crack was first synthesized by scientists  and  chemists  working for the CIA.  Which is  almost entirely funded by the sale of narcotics,  used crack and it's addictive properties to repress and extort  The already alienated ghettos of America.  Or anyone that can look at a map and say Jesus was not white.  That literally makes no sense and also the common depiction of Jesus was actually the son of a  incestuous pedophile Pope near the 14th century.  Lies for Whites only, no more."
"What do black slaves have to do with this, and why do you capitalize ""Black slaves""?"
"The Ku Klux Klan tries to recruit future white supremacists in high schools and at high school football games.
The sick racists distributed propaganda fliers at a football game at Gray’s Creek High School in North Carolina.
Racist comments about Jews, Mexicans and Muslims were written atop the Confederate flag, also attacking Black Lives Matter, recent NFL take-a-knee protests, and black culture.
They were left on cars during the game and criticized any removal of Confederate flags and Confederate monuments as a sign that people do not ""respect the white majority of America,"" providing evidence that the historic Confederate symbols do indeed fuel white supremacy."
"Trump is showing a little too much here.  He is called a racist, bigot, and much worse by higher profile people than an ESPN host.  Yet, where is the outrage towards them?  Oooohhhh, this just happens to be a black female.  Aaaahhhh... OK."
What these femanazis fail to realize is that President Trump has employed and cut paychecks to more women blacks latinos gays lesbians transgendereds and muslims than all previous presidents combined.  Is there any way we can find out where these women work so we can boycott those businesses?
"""If there had been no Black Lives Matter activism, the alt-right would have invented it. They are profoundly committed to a belief in the importance of the tribe, and they define tribe in racial terms.""

Neo Nazi's would have invented a movement that demonizes the police?   I don't follow.

Statistics shows that more white people than blacks are shot by police.   Where are the ""alt right"" marches that lament this state of affairs, and call for the murder of police?

Again.....where are these ""alt right"" fanatics that MSW speaks of?

What a Boogeyman, what made-up Monster.    A generation of Americans freaking out about a tribalist movement of violent white people who don't exist except in teensy numbers."
"I agree, and while youre at it, why dont you ask all blacks, browns, etc. to leave, not just BLM.  That will surely solve the non-existent problems of racism and police brutality, complaints about carding, etc. wouldnt it?  I mean all our problems would be solved if they would all just 'go back to where they came from' (given their presence in this country since the 1600s, not sure how we'd do this but am sure you could figure it out).   Sadly your comments suggest not your privilege but reflects your utter ignorance of the experience of racialised people in this country.  SMDH."
"Da, da, comrade. Doesn't matter what the facts show, you keep saying that Hillary is the bigger liar, and that someone with a ""black friend"" cannot possibly be racist, even after he BothSidered actual Nazis (besides all the other things he has done) and pardoned his good BFF and birther buddy, the racist sheriff Arpaio."
"Emotionally instabile people . There is no mechanism to lock them up. So we have to use our own judgement to protect ourselves. The wife of the murderer should probably have known by his previous behavior she is in danger and carried a gun all the time. Also good to keep in mind:  In 2013, a black was six times more likely than a non-black to commit murder.  https://www.amren.com/archives/reports/the-color-of-crime-2016-revised-edition/  just yesterday gym owners/supervisors were killed by a black employee."
"The Largest Democrat Voting Blocs are the Mentally Ill, Sex Workers, Sex Sellers, Drug Dealers, Drug Addicts, Child Molesters, Human Traffickers, NAMBLA members, pornographers, those in Prison or on Parole, Abortion Industry and Planned Parenthood workers, Illegal Aliens, the ""Registered Dead"", those who Are Anti-American, BLM Members, ANTIFA Members, Radical Blacks, Radical Muslims and those who want to Control Freedom.

This group is approximately 30% to 40% of the American Voters - DO NOT EXPECT THIS GROUP TO SUPPORT our President."
"It came across to me as being written by Bannon.  All the references to saving civilization and clashes of civilizations and tradition and nationalism are all alt right dog whistles referencing the supremacy of white civilization and the need to hunker down and protect white civilization from all those 'colored' inferior people.  Putin and Trump are now best bros who will save white Europe and North America from the yellow, brown, and black hordes."
"A deep commitment to truth can serve as a hedge against despair. As can humour. Both are abundant in Coates' essay. Thanks for the link. I'm especially grateful for Coates' Baldwin quotation near the end, ""...whites “have brought humanity to the edge of oblivion: because they think they are white,” ...""  

On Baldwin -- did you see ""I am not your Negro"" ?  Such a remarkable man."
"She's not just guilty of ""jumping to conclusions""--she's guilty of outright bigotry.  And my remarks represent my objection to a legitimate social/political struggle being hijacked by by a fifth column with its own agenda--an agenda which proves particularly harmful to black women in this country.

One example of this hypocrisy you seem so ready to swallow is the double-standard of lesbo-nazis promoting ""gay"" marriage out of one corner of their mouths while shrilly condemning polygynous marriage out the other."
"I don't agree Mr. Trump is a racist, but racism also exists in all people of all races, black race included. Muhammad Ali, Lyndon Johnson, many were racists, Elderidge Cleaver loved talking about raping white women, Ali racial inter-marriage, Johnson was a racist. Heck the Nation of Islam had George Lincoln Rockwell sitting proudly up front with his pals, all in full Nazi regalia surround by hundreds of Blacks who they had things in common with! It's in all races, and today even our universities like Harvard, where Asians are discriminated against.

  But either way as I said before, your past issuance of personal insults to myself and others, leave little to be constructive, and I decline further discussion with you respectfully Q HALL, AMBER COLLINS, DALE GROSS, or whatever moniker you've adopted to use today respectfully. 
Have a wonderful evening."
"You're the one who basically said any blacks who support the rebel flag down south do so out of stupidity. I personally wouldn't fly the rebel flag because I have no attachment to it, but I have known some black people who have their own reasons for flying it. It's not my place to tell someone what is and is not acceptable, I'm not a member of the thought police community."
"You are considered innocent until proven guilty. Black folks are suspects for merely being present. The police don't profile white men. A white man can argue with a cop while having an AR-15 on his shoulder and live to tell the story. Black folks including children are killed by police for the mere suspicion of being armed.   White men are not stopped and frisked. I could go on. I have 400 years of white racist material. We could spend years reviewing racism in the criminal justice system alone.  The good news is that younger white folks tend to be less racist than their elders. BTW, You don't have to do anything to get your white male privilege. Just show up white."
"Don't get mad at the cops. Get made at the millions of other black guys who have committed   an endless stream of mindless and violent crimes against persons, property, and society. Black guys have an 80 times greater risk of being shot by other black guys than by cops, But cops have to clean up the blood. They see it every day and their own experience forewarn them of what to expect and who they are at greatest risk from. Many innocent blacks are collateral damage in the collapse of black urban culture. Despite being just 8% of the population (yup that's all) even you must grasp how much of society's problems stem from fatherless black kids running wild."
"Jamilah King and Jagger Blaec the two writers responsible for the ""Cultural Appropriation"" articles about white people making Mexican food in Oregon are both black, late 20's to mid 30's, and share a common goal, to attain fame through shaming others. After looking at both their twitter feeds two things stand out. Anger at anything white and the lack of a male role model in childhood. Being misandristic and racist is the meme of the day for millennials of color in today's liberal media. King is a strong backer of Black Lives Matter, and Blaec consistently writes of the strife of females of color.While I can appreciate both issues, both of these writers have an extremely tainted point of view breed solely from anger at white people taught to them by regressive single-parent families. Perhaps these two need a dose of reality, that all people have difficulties in life, that there are two choices, 1) to be angry and blame others or 2) rise up from emotionalism rhetoric and become a leader."
"DoingitWrong:  The homeowner could have also potentially been Homophobic, and feared that the naked man wanted to have sex with him.

Just because there is a naked black man inside your home, does not mean that it is OK to shoot him."

HE IS BEHAVING LIKE A PRIVATE ARMY OF THE ANC WITH HIS WITCH-HUNT OF SOME PEOPLE THROUGH HIS POLICE!HE HAS SETUP A SPECIAL UNIT TO DEAL WITH CRITICS OF HIS COLLEAGUES .HOW MANY BLACKS HAVE DIED SINCE INDEPENDENCE KILLED BY THE FARMERS HE IS DEFENDING AND THE POLICE.!
"Your message is just as racist and ignorant as the white supremacist that thinks all blacks should be kicked out of our country because of the crime statistics.
.
I am a white male. I have never done any of the things you mention above, why should *I* feel guilty? White Americans have done some atrocious things in our history, I recognize that. However, *I* never had a hand in it. I've never aided or abetted such activities nor have I condoned such activities. Because of this, I do not feel guilty about it nor will *I* be held accountable for it.
.
Also, I believe we should not bury this valuable human rights lesson. We should learn from it and grow from it not attempt to use it as a weapon for racism."
"Trump's Chief Executive, Stephen Bannon is a racist. Bannon, the head of Breitbart News is an extreme bigot who is has published anti-Latino, anti-LGTQUI, anti-black, and anti-Semitic material for years.  In addition, he has attacked many white supporters. ANYONE who promotes cultural or racial diversity.   Even the former editor of Breitbart News, Ben Shapiro, stated, Bannon and has “embraced the white supremacist alt-right alongside Bannon’s embrace of Trump.” Bannon openly supports the “alt-right,” racists, and white nationalists. 

In addition, Trump brought in Nigel Farage an extreme right-winger from Britain. Farage is so extreme; Britain doesn’t even want him back.  British leaders refer to Farage (ex-leader of the UKIP) and his followers as “retro-nationalists, not patriots.”   Cottrell, Farage's office manager was arrested for fraud and money laundering AT the RNC.  They are all cons.

Why would any person of color vote for a white nationalist or anyone who supports them?"
"Your attempt to put moral values in my mouth merely reflects your own black bigotry and preferences.  

Man up and deal with your own shortcomings instead of blaming them on 300 years of 'white privilege'.

Millions of other blacks have done it over the last 300 years; are you man enough to do it too?

Millions of them became successful/  

Your professional victimhood is unpersuasive and counterproductive."
"This really says a lot about Trump's perspective when it comes to seniors, the poor, and the disabled. 
When a President selects an ambassador he makes sure he selects one with great knowledge and talent in countries he considers important. But he selects his campaign supporters for countries where he just doesn't care. So if one gets a career, talented ambassador, one knows that that country is important.

Now, Ben Carson's selection says Trump just doesn't care to select someone with knowledge of the complicated life at HUD, in fact, to me, this signals that Trump will be doing what he can to pull a ""Reagan"", use tax cuts to the rich to impoverish the low income seniors and disabled people who depend on HUD housing. 
So he has selected a woman to help destroy the Department of Public Education, and a black man to help destroy HUD. 
Diversity.
Time will tell if I am being too disrespectful and fearful. 
Hugh Massengill, Eugene"
"Trump is more angry at a black man for leaving the President's Manufacturing Council than he was about an American being murdered by his supporters.
Hmmm.  So the issue isn't white supremacists and Nazis, it's black CEOs."
"Does ""our own"" include black and brown people?"
"Police officers have led to the murders of blacks, so now where are we? Well, I'll tell you. Out of the two groups, only one swears an oath to uphold the law, the cops, yet they do not hold up the law. In fact, they use their government granted powers to commit crimes against innocent people, notably blacks."
"Who:  I think we could spend unending time blaming each other.....liberals blame the conservatives; conservatives blame the liberals; Blacks blame the police; police blame the Black community.  Republicans blame President Obama; Democrats blame President Bush. and so forth.  What would it accomplish?  A great deal......and none of it good.  How about us all looking at the situation and trying to do our small part to help make things better.  Things are a real mess. The level of trust between the police and much of the Black community is a as low a level as I've seen since the pre-Civil Rights days.  I we can't all work together to make things better, they're only going to get worse.  I agree with your (unstated) suggestion.....we do, indeed, need to ratchet-down the rhetoric.  regards, Gary"
wow you know so much.  What are you going to do with out a black man in white house to rant about?
"All I want is for the police to stop killing unarmed black people including children. I consider that state sponsored murder with the police union contracts defending that behavior. The police have never thought protecting and serving black Americans as a priority. In fact, they have been known to work with the Klan to murder black folks over the years."
"Charles Barkley once said he figured out the difference between being rich (as he was) and being wealthy like Miami Heat owner Mickey Arson when Arson'a yacht broke down at dockside and he ordered his back up yacht to come over. Barkley also wrote in his book, the real legacy of slavery is the lack of wealth in black families. We are just starting to see the first few black children who are born into wealth, such as Michael Jordan's children, or if Oprah had children. But the whites have a several generations head start, made all the worse by the fact that their wealth, at least from the South, was realized by stealing the labor of the blacks."
"Take the blinders off, Bill, non-whites are disrespected somewhere in America, hourly.  How do you figure it is any different from the past, just because Blacks are now allowed to drink from the same water fountains as whites?  Our president has put all of us on notice that he prefers whites."
Agreed Moe.  Lord knows if it was a white police officer shooting a black criminal we would have heard the race.
"Our thugs are better than the alt-right's thugs.  At the core, groups like BLM have a righteous beef (poor treatment of blacks by police).  At the core, the alt-right is simply beefing about having their white privilege revoked.  Civil rights won, get over it."
"""bigots in South Africa are like bigots in the US, nothing but ignorant, thuggish racists.""  

And yet, on the telly, they all appear to be the same skin color! 

An Interesting definition of 'racist' by you there, ""Baas"", (as you might be referred to in Afrikaans)!  

Those arrested in South Africa were black residents  beating on other blacks who were illegal  immigrants whom the residents blamed for taking their jobs and livelihoods.   

Any ""Racism"" is only seen through racist eyes; yours.  

Which could have been avoided if you had actually read the story instead of having that little knee-jerk thing happen."
"Only the ignorant think this is about skin color.  I thought the bus driver who was assaulted is black. 
Race card FAIL as usual."
"""They represent us well with their thoughtful, clear responses to President Donald Trump and their strong stands against hateful white supremacist philosophies, policies and actions.""

Remind me again what they said against ANTIFA...BLM...Black Panthers?"
There will be race riots and cities across America will burn if black folks on welfare and food stamps are expected to clean hotel rooms or flip burgers.
Unfortunately  so many of these rappers have help destroy Black culture.  Sad very sad.
"His ""upbringing wouldn't necessarily support that perception"", ie that he is black?  I'm sorry, RockChalk, but this statement is a bit strange.
Surely, you are not suggesting that African Americans, or black people in general, bring up their children in a way that is different than that of white people?   
What did you mean?"
"You have a better level of experience than some, but you are still not black nor have you lived in black neighborhood.   My relations were mostly assoicated with my education.  These were most guys recruited in St. Louis, Kansas City and amazingly several from New York.  They had been in street violence, some rough neighborhoods.  I also stayed a week in a St Louis projects area, there only by permission of local gang agreement through a church in that interacted with my college professor.. Gunshots heard at night were common.   But that was 1975 and things change.   It was a short experience a long time ago.

So anyway, what did you learn from those black guys in the army."
"""Anti-white"". LOL. Historical fact is anti-white? What a snowflake. In your world, unless you venerate white supremacist symbols, you're ""anti-white"". I'm anti-racism, not anti-white. Stop including all white people into your white supremacist club.

Keep enabling your crybaby neo-Nazi, white nationalist and Confederate snowflakes as they cry at the removal of one traitorous racist Confederate statue after another. You are on the wrong side of history. 

Have fun telling your grand kids how you caped for anti-black race-based slavery in 2017. There was no war to save indentured servitude, which used free white labor for a period of 7 years. Nope. The racist South went to war to preserve race-based inter-generational slavery using only black Americans. So save your objective look at slavery. Your people didn't endure 400 years of slavery and Jim Crow in the ""land of the free"". Your ancestors couldn't have handled it, crybaby. You snowflakes are ""oppressed"" when a statue is removed."
"White athletes?  Don't black athletes rape????  

And the charges DO have to be investigated, don't they?  There does seem to be quite a few false claims lately - for example, ask Rolling Stone magazine.

Rape is a disgusting and reprehensible crime - and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  No one accepts it - but it is not just whites and not all claims are true."
"Exactly. If he was black, BLM wouldn't protest his death because he was armed and posed a real threat. Throwing hatchets at the police is a good way to catch a bullet. APD isn't in the habit of shooting unarmed citizens and I don't expect that to change no matter what their ethnicity is."
You failed to address my points. When will black Americans take responsibility for their conduct?
"Don't just take my word for it. Read this analysis by Propane Jane. It's as if she's deconstructing every one of your tired cliched stereotypical patronizing comments from earlier today.

Pull quote:

""As the mythology goes, these misfortunes are visited upon Black Americans exclusively because our feeble minds have been brainwashed by the Democratic Party plantation.

Never mind the scores of White Americans in Appalachia, the Deep Red South, and the Rust Belt, who religiously vote Republican, and still live in the exact same socioeconomic conditions Trump describes.

Never mind the fact that the majority of Black Americans are considered middle class, just as the majority of White Americans are.""

As long as the condescending Southern Strategy GOP keeps patronizing and belittling black Americans and taking away any agency black people have, you'll never earn the black vote. Never."
"I heard about Leah McLaren from comments in Margaret Wendt's article about Are Today's Dad's really so pathetic? I had to check it out. And I have kept an open mind.  But, reading her (McLaren's) work is like pulling hangnails. She has some good points, but her smugness against dads is quite telling. Her use of slang like 'snowflakes' and 'whevs' ('whatever' in a valley girl dialect?) is instructive. She talks about how much praise to give to children THEN switches to husbands, speaking as though men are like children and women are the adults who have to train their dogs. Her condescension is appalling. 

One reason I am writing here is that Father's Day articles give back-handed insults to men. (""Kids are fat? - Blame dad"") Happy Father's Day! Ms. McLaren should follow Janice Fiamengo who mentions the difficult, dirty, dangerous jobs done by men who get no gratitude. Bill Burr quipped ""All the mothers with black lung!"" And Oprah telling men to ""BE BETTER!"" a year ago with Ms. Obama."
"Horribly written articles like this are why newspapers are dying. The article is 2 paragraphs and 1 sentence long stating that ""black students and teachers face inequities"" and that 11 recommendations were made, yet they aren't listed, nor are the challenges that black students and teachers face. Since there was no data provided, what was the point of this article?"
"Icon, in answer to your query to me, I'd like to think everyone had abandoned those old race-based notions by now. I prefer ""ethnic"" but that seems too academic for some people.  Not to get bogged down on terminology but  you can define me as a ""race constructivist"" if you must label me.
Naturally by ""white"" I'm referring  to an ethnic group socially defined as ""white"", so we could use the term ""SDAW"" or ""Socially Defined As White.""  If you saw me you could label me a SDAW. By the same token, we could use the term ""SDAB"" or Socially Defined As Black for those folks who are being stereotyped by blackface. (Not ""black makeup"")

Beyond the terminology, my point was that a small group of students wanting  to see this tenured prof fired   for wearing blackface  (impossible)  hardly comprise a ""lynch mob"" and to even make such a comparison suggests a gross misunderstanding of American history-- see those postcards to see what SDAW did to SDAB in real lynch mobs."
"Thanks for making it clear that you don't understand the issues. No one is protesting that stuff. 100% of shark attacks happen in water, but no one is protesting that. You must wonder why. You must also wonder why the Police Benevolent Association is not the American Heart Association. You must think that police don't care about heart disease. Earn your GED and learn that Kaepernick and the others are protesting the issue of their choice (freedom of America, right?), and that issue is dirty cops killing blacks. Period."
"The two examples given involved professional protestors.  They were looking for a fight.  Used their ""blackness"" as a weapon.  Unfortunately for American Airlines or any business, it's a no win situation.  Blacks hurt their cause by doing these types of things.  When there is real discrimination and injustice, nobody will take them seriously."
The fact that there are only black men from Arapahoe county on Colorado's death row suggests that jurors are more sympathetic to white perpetrators.
I'm not sure I see a pattern of racial discrimination in favor of black people in this country.  Do you have any studies that don't include cherry-picked items?
Start your own law firm and be as black as you want to be.
Pride is now a celebration of Black Suprematism.  What will BLM demand next year? This is just proof that they can get away with anything. Santa Parade too White. Black only TCHC buildings? Winning this will only encourage more extortion and segregation in the name of peace and inclusiveness. It is all a big lie.
"So true. It's not like Trump's chief strategist ran ""the platform for the alt right"" or that Trump himself consistently adopted and retweeted racist images and messages generated on white supremacist message boards or that Trump himself consistently barred black people from living in his buildings or that Trump himself repeatedly described black people as intrinsically lazy. No, there's absolutely no hint of evidence that Trump is any more of a White Supremacist than your average joe goebbels."
"i am sorry if I offended you, I thought you would have been fine with it.  The reason why I said white boys is that whites were the largest group of Donald's supporters.  Even white women voted for him.  Do you deny this?  

Just curious but did you complain when people said Obama on got in only because all of the blacks voted for him just because he was black?   Maybe you did."
"OK, so algebra discriminates against black politicians, too."
Yes our republican president who is bringing back honor and class .  Isn't it great that we don't have that black guy as president embarrasing the country all the time?       lol
"Technical?  Wow.

The topic is respect for the flag as a symbol of our nation.

I don't see how you can conflate the death of drug addicts with the senseless deaths of thousands of kids sent into a meat grinder because ""the best and the brightest"" couldn't admit they made a mistake.

Neither can I think of any reason to respect leaders who would perpetuate such an atrocity. 

Some people of color, and many, many white folks on their behalf, are having trouble respecting some of our law enforcer right now.  

As an employer, the NFL can make any rule they want within the confines of reason.  As the player himself indicated, he is willing to take the risk of retribution. 

I'm willing to let him worry about that for himself."
"The entire BLM movement and Black police brutality issue is based on a lie that Blacks are being unfairly targeted by police and the event that started it all "" Hands up Don't shoot "" with Michael Brown was a total hoax, disproven by multiple BLACK witnesses. Statistically, White men are more likely to be shot or killed by Police in police encounters than are Black men. People really need to read "" The War on Police"" by Heather MacDonald which uses facts and evidence to smash the liberal media narrative on Black crime and Police relations with the Black community. Blacks are not being unfairly targeted. The problem is that crime is out of control in the Black community. 50% of murders take place entirely within the Black community even though Blacks are just 12% of the US population. That is why they encounter the police so often."
"LOL. What most people dont know was the makeup of the 'Obama coalition' - the majority of whites didn't vote for BO so there was never any hope of a post-racial America. I understand reasonable disagreement with his politics but what he faced during his tenure was backlash from whites on a rampage of 'we want our country back' (read 'uppity N', how dare you) and a congress whose goal was to ensure he had 'no wins' even when it was a republican idea (Romneycare). MO was described by these racists as having a 'certain kind of uppitiness'. Lets face it, conservatives exhibit a mean/hateful streak (toward democrats) that was exacerbated by BO being black. It is clear to any reasonable person that he is classy, dignified, and yes, cool (if one has a clue what these mean) but haters are not about to give him that either. I would just note the privileged white 'republican' poised to take the office versus how BO carried himself under the onslaught."
"The acquittal of the Bundy clan on conspiracy charges in Oregon last week is probably the finest example of white privilege one can find. These so-called patriots occupied a federal building, pointed guns at law enforcement officers, and are now walking away scot-free. Yet Native Americans protesting this pipeline are being pepper-sprayed, assaulted, arrested, and, as some ill-informed comments in this thread demonstrate, vilified as trespassers, layabouts, and welfare scammers. Black Lives Matter activists face the same marginalization. Race remains the defining issue in our society and politics today."
Next on the agenda after certain people finish cleaning history of all mention of those terrible white people. What to do with the people of color who owned so many Native American slaves and the thousands of black slave owners. Which black slave owners should we start with? Has anyone checked on how many prominent people of color have slave owning relatives in their family trees. It's a great comfort knowing that people of color whose history is thousands of years longer than all those evil white people are untarnished by some relative in distant history owning slaves.
"Why are you so bothered by black wealth ? The way Afrikaners speak as if they do not give each other tenders perplexes me honestly. Why are you constantly scrutinising how black people attained their wealth. It must first be questioned, legitimised before it can be accepted by Afrikaners. Your assumption is always that it must have been stolen."
Is 1/3 black too much for you?
What do black slave# not have to do with this & only the word Black is capitalized. An error on Your part.
"My post was civil.  I think I must have asked too many sensible questions that someone didn't want other people to think about such as ""What were Black people doing when they were shot by police?"" and also something about numbers of Blacks shot by police vs Blacks shot by Blacks."
"What about the non violent folks stopped just because they are black or Native American on some silly made up excuse, there are plenty of videos online showing nonviolent folks getting beat or shot. There are very few repercussions for cops that do anything.
We have had AST personal shoot several people before much happened to them, one was the legless fellow at a pulloff, I think he was the second for that ""law enforcement "" person. Another was the second victim of a female AST, shoot a native in Delta that even the other cop there thought was uncalled for.
I think felons and perps of domestic violence should lose all guns, that way our cops will be safer on the next call, it's no wonder some are so scared. We do have plenty of good decent police why put them in danger?
Maybe black people run because they know the entire ""justice system"" is stacked against them and they don't want to be beat or killed like their friends have been."
"I don't know. I wouldn't support it because it is easy to imagine it as a kind of hate speech. It would be stupid though, because people would definitely let you know how they felt about such garb. More power to them, I say. 

But again, you make a false equivalency. How is a KKK hood and a freely chosen niqab the same? I can see why a black person would be harmed by a troop of KKK people on the subway. How are you harmed by a group of women with a niqab?"
"This will be the next African nation to fall and then it will look like Zimbabwe. So sad that through all of these years, the blacks still do not have access to public education so the result will be the same for most of them--more poverty, more tribalism and more corruption. The whites are exiting."
"Of course, if you watch any one of numerous videos of police officers shooting unarmed blacks, you realize your point is baloney."
"why does black feel that the public needs to see the detailed negotiations of the chief's settlement?  the commission by law is the authority to deal with issues involving the chief, so let them so the work.  is black trying to subvert the law and allow public opinion to influence the work of the commission?  this is really stupid.  we are a nation of laws and they must be followed.   people have the right to voice their opinion but it is done so following the law.  if they do not like the work of the commission than they can voice their opinion, but the commission in following the law, does not need to change their decisions.  the chief has given the city over 30 years of honorable service.  everyone makes mistakes, so this mistake should not erase the good things he did, he earned his retirement.  in regards to the separation pay, since he was on a contract, it is normal that if the contract is terminated for any reason, cash payments are involved."
"Would the statement, ""please don't continue to threaten my black/Jewish/Muslim neighbors"" also be on your list?"
"You can dislike the facts, but you can't dispute the facts. White Nationalism is tied to Nazism, something my family and millions upon millions of whites fought against along with our black brothers. So watch it before you make assumptions. The black man is my brother and I will defend him. But Tell me your thoughts on Black Supremacy, black identity, brown pride and what, if anything, should white people do or say about it? And if possible stay away from the assumptions/insults and make an argument."
"And the best part is Obama and Bush carried out basically the same foreign policy of disastrous misadventures in the Middle East. Obama spent more and racked up more debt than all previous presidents combined. Race relations are worse than they were since the 1960's. His only legacy other than destruction of our influence and stature is a failed healthcare law which no one likes save a few true believers. All propped up by a dishonest and complicit media who can't criticize the first ""black"" president. These guys are still blaming Bush, who was also a nightmare."

"I am not quite sure what you are trying to say.  But I think you are looking at it from the wrong end.  A business open to the public, Masterpiece Cakeshop, is refusing to provide a cake for a gay couple.  The business is not participating in a religious ceremony, nor is it practicing a religion.  (Businesses do not have religions.)  Since it is open to the public, it may no more discriminate against gays than a diner in the South could lawfully refuse to serve black people."

There was a white woman having an affair with a black guy in unit 3. They deserve this
Changing curriculum is one thing but doing so for the reasons stated is blatantly racist and unacceptable. If kids can't be expected to perform their school work because the guy who wrote is too white then why even let white people teach. It is amazing that this is being discussed seriously and to see how ridiculous it is we only need to imagine a white person complaining about having to read the works of black or otherwise non white writers.

"The entire government was created to dehumanize black slaves. It was the foundation  of the macro economics of the nation. We have been working on becoming a more perfect union ever since. In 1860, 80% of the wealth of the nation was in black slaves and their labor. The stuff you talk about only applied to white men."

"Wrong. Every vote in FL was NOT counted! That included tens of thousands of Black registered voters who were illegally kicked off polls, whose votes never went to anyone. Ultimately the overwhelmingly Catholic Supreme Court made the final call there. But go ahead...  keep blaming Nader. That chip on your shoulder will break your back one of these days."
"Thanks for the civil response. You jerk. (haha, riposte!)
I'll say what black athletes will tell you. Many white coaches don't make them feel comfortable. That was Helf's problem: he just couldn't relate to inner city type kids nor they to him. 
Dana probably is a nice guy (knowing about the sexual investigation and charges of that player a few years back and admitting him was a grievous mistake, as was claiming he knew nothing); he previously worked for many years at a private, exclusive school--- yeah, he'll get older kids from other programs, he'll get kids from other countries (same issue we had with our Australian pipelined volleyball team) but he just doesn't seem (a la Helf) to have the ability to get those sublime one-and-done athletes. 
The facilities, school rep, and parent quotient (Eugene's boring rep is popular w/worried ones) could lead to great recruiting: look at Taggart's results where some argued it was impossible."
"Good point, making a sweeping characterization that most Latinos and Blacks are uneducated in no way appears racist.  And as always, you are correct, it is always proper to respond to a perceived attack by engaging in the same conduct.  Since you believe others have referred to certain white groups as uneducated, you are completely justified in characterizing any non-white group you wish in the same manner.  As Jesus taught, turnabout is fair play."
"The elephant in the room here is the anti-Semitism on the Left, a topic everybody is politely stepping around. Anti-Semitic Blacks have murdered more Jews in the United States since the 1980s than white supremacists have. Fact check that claim. The one thing everybody in Charlottesville, left and right, certainly could have agreed on is ""Jews will not replace us."" I am an Orthodox Jew and do not say that facetiously. In fact, thank G-d, white supremacists have been relegated to the dust heap for all practical purposes since the 1970s. Much more currently prevalent and dangerous is the anti-Semitism of the Left, buttressed by the most mainstream of universities, academics and Liberal business leaders. It is now dangerous to be openly Jewish on many U.S. college campuses. (https://www.algemeiner.com/the-40-worst-colleges-for-jewish-students-2016/) Israel is routinely demonized. BDS is popular among large swathes of our population. Farrakhan, Sharpton, Wright are still respected figures."

"Are you sure that the ""black-clad punks"" (fascists) who caused so much damage were UCB students?"
"Gee seems to purposely miss the point - it's not a gay community issue, it's a black community issue, including black Torontonians who are gay.  Black community members find it difficult obviously, to march along side a police force that has long targeted black men. I'm neither black nor gay and while I've attended Pride and support it, it's not rocket science to understand the black community's push on our police force, levering the parade as a tool to make their point. It's smart. It's working. But for the Globe to purposely mis-position this as a gay community issue, is silly and unhelpful and ignores the legitimate complaints that black men are still targeted by our police no matter their economic status."
"Yet they didn't kick out the Native half of the act. The only difference was the black guy asked why? Put yourself in his shoes, what conclusions would you come to?"
For me your comment takes the cake. You were not disrespected! If you served the country we are proud of you and thank you for your service. Don't get your panties in a bunch. This protest is not about our military. It about how America(some folks who are Americans) treat and allow mistreatment of It's citizens namely police behavior towards black and brown men.
Honey?  Did you read the article?  She attacked Pope Francis for saying that countries should be welcoming of immigrants.  That is her whole platform.  That France would be better if she could kick out all the dark skinned people and Muslims.

Look at the lack of attention for the little boy in the flash T-shirt. How sad. The Potus and his PR team's agenda has been exposed."

He has received more than 60 honorary doctorate degrees, dozens of national merit citations, and written over 100 neurosurgical publications.

Trump has selected him for his cabinet, too.  

Trump, the racist, also has an Orthodox Jewish son-in-law and his daughter converted to Judaism.

"Correct, I don't see them complaining that 11 out of 13 players on each team in the NBA are Black. Racial inequality is ALL in the mind.  For goodness sake, we just had a Black President.
The players message should be: ""DON""T BE A FOOL- STAY IN SCHOOL"". But, they have NO message. NO solution to their imagined grievances.
And, of course, they never tell other Blacks to stop killing each other. Blacks killing other Blacks is epidemic proportions.

Dear White People, why are you so threatened by a light comedy called Dear White People? Do you feel guilty about something? Do you see colour first when you interact with people of colour? Do you stereotype?

Why was Leslie Jones the most picked upon of the three women in the Ghostbusters remake? Why did so many infantile men have a problem with women starring as well as revealing such hatred toward a black woman?

Some ask what I'd say about a show called Dear Black People. I dunno. Tell me about it. What would it be about? Would it be about a man explaining why he joined the KKK? Would it explain why Obama's skin colour upset so many members of the Tea Party? I'm asking, because I don't think the haters have thought it through"
And so many South Africans for years have been throwing stone in glass houses and calling for Zimbabweans to rise up and change their despot piglet Mad Bad Bob for someone more in tune with their needs. It was always so easy to sit behind a keyboard and say - vote for change. Dont allow Bob to go rogue - and that is exactly what he did. And that is exactly what South Africans are currently doing. The whites will NEVER stand up and rise to fight this regime change and the BLACKS will tear each other apart eventually due to factionalism. The problem is there is NOTHING that we can do other than take it up the butt - as usual.
"im glad she talked to trump. if everyone did, maybe he would see the errors of some of his appointments and statements. a no fly zone, as envisioned by clinton, was an area in syria, agreed to by syria, russia and the u.s. where syrian civilians could flee to and not be bombed by anyone. i wonder is tusli noticed that trump didnt invite any ugly, black, hispanic, muslim, or any other, congresswomen to join the discussion."

"hmmm, what kine mental problems? She has 4 kids, called cops to report a burglary of sorts, etc. and apparently knows right from wrong. I'm not a psychiatrist, kinda sad calling the cops knowingly they'll investigate your complaint yet doesn't know when to drop a weapon. Hmmm, I'm just saying not knowing the facts of what happened but of a one-sided story. We've heard everyone condemning the cops, I'd like to hear the cops story. I'm not defending the cops and wanting to know the ""whole"" story of the incident. For all we know, it could be Racists cops just pulling the trigger as the Liberal Media pointed out it was White cops shooting a black person that I definitely condemn them if it's the truth."
"I haven't heard anyone else mention this, maybe I missed it: maybe the ""Hysterical Left"" (maybe that's my own term too) should be falling to their knees in thanks to President Trump? Because: Honestly do you think these ""Symbols of Hate"" would be coming down across the nation, under Hillary? Did they come down under Husband Bubba? Did they come down under Obama? No. Even under a black President, the statues stood tall. Donald Trump is a closet Genius. Or maybe forget the closet All Together."

Charles is the bigot-in-chief here at the R-G based on his continual whining about 'white privilege' etc.

The black people I worked for, with and supervised were men and women who would be offended to have someone think they needed 'affirmative action' or 'special' treatment just because of their skin color.   The first one I met was the son of a New York surgeon who was Jewish because that's the religion of his family when other blacks in Africa captured and sold them to the British.

The same was true of lots of Hispanics, ""NewYoricans"" (their term; not mine) Native Americans, and all kinds of other people who weren't riding the privileged racial status gravy train the civilian world thinks is necessary.

"Comments sections are great for the same reason Trump is great: they shine a  light on the squalid little black heart of the self-styled ""conservative"" movement and display how vapid and morally and intellectually empty its true believers truly are. 

In this thread, observe the common rhetorical conservative ""tactic"" of 1) making a race-baiting comment; 2) when called out for said race-baiting comment, trying to turn the tables to say ""you're really the racist! You brought race into this!"" These people who do this are unable to help themselves; they were raised on a steady diet of resentment  and think poking fun at the physical characteristics and ancestry of other people is the height of wit. 

They know they're being left behind by a world that finds them as distasteful and ignorant as the people who threw rocks at little black girls getting off school buses in the 50s.  Unable to adjust, they resent those who did. So they vent here. The dogs bark but the caravans move on."

"As a retired Civil Servant I begin to get a picture of what it must be like to be black or Jewish or Muslim, everything wrong with our tax structure is our fault. It is suggested that we are costing the government billions of dollars extra without one shred of supporting documentation.  Just how much is the pension costing Canadians over what is being contributed by workers.

I do know that probably twenty years ago there was a substantial surplus in the pension account (billions of dollars) which was scooped by the government of the day to put into general revenue over the objection of the Public Service Unions.  In taking the staff contributions government promised they would make up any future deficit. This they would probably like to forget today.

Well, they do matter to the killers because the black victims are interfering with the killers' businesses of drugs, protection and prostitution.  They also kill the Hispanics who try and muscle in on their territory.  

It's mostly just business.    

Reality sucks!"
"So black people just don't know how to talk to the police and that's why they're killed? What? Explain then, why 8 different white guys, with guns  pointed at the police, ended up alive. Black people don't seem to fair as well. Have you ever worked retail, Larry? The rudest people are white. I think you need to find a new reason for the discrepancy."
"""There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery. Then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved"" - Jesse Jackson

Not even black activists trust other black people.  Are you seriously expecting other people too?"
"Maybe if the “voiceless”, as you so euphemistically refer to them, weren’t so busy robbing, assaulting, and murdering other “voiceless” people, their interactions with the police would be more pleasant.  This whole inane protest is based upon a foundation of lies, beginning with Mr. “hands up, don’t shoot” himself, Michael Brown.

While I have no doubt that the players do not think of it in this way, they are essentially protesting for the right of violent criminals to resist and/or assault police officers without consequence.  Nearly every recent example that has undergirded the “Black Lives Matter” agenda has involved a completely justifiable police shooting.  In only one example that I can think of, the one involving the man on the street in New York City who was suffocated, was there any reasonable question about the actions of the officers involved.  Also frequently ignored is the fact that in some of these cases the “evil” officers were themselves black."
And today more black Americans will murder their fellow citizens than were killed in Montreal.  So what 's your point- violence and murder are not entirely owned by by Muslims.  So we don't need you faulty analysis.

"Liberals tend to be rich and well off.  They (IMHO) like to think of themselves as good and others as bad.  Nevertheless, they look out for themselves first.  For example, one of the most serious problems for blacks is the criminal justice system.  A significant percentage get slapped with some felony level crime that comes with poverty and oppression.  But the liberals are perfectly happy with a criminal justice system which locks up a black man for years for robbing $200 bucks from a convenience store thus destroying his family and perverting the lives of his children.  Moreover, he is publicly labelled a felon for life with no chance for redemption to record-free status and relegated via ""background checks"" to menial jobs for life.  You don't hear the liberals complaining about this system or work to change it to one in which rehabilitation and redemption is the focus.  So the liberals (or actually fake liberals compared to the past) sputter on uselessly about white supremacists."
"Oh, baloney.  Of course I spoke up, and was treated as an embarrassment.  Don't you understand that having to have a white person speak up for them is part of what Blacks are protesting?"

"I see the DP has already posted six separate stories about this incident, and I'm sure there are more to come.

Last month when a Muslim black man in Fresno shot and killed three random white men on the street because he hates white people, the DP posted a grand total of three stories - and one of those was actually a story about gunfire sensors used by the police.  

I wonder why there's a disparity in coverage."

If this were really a capitalist nation, white folks would have to pay for that help. Most white folk refuse to pay for that help. I guess socialism works for white folks when it is based on racial discrimination. Some white folks just can't take responsibility for their choices.

That's really all that needs to be said about the current situation. Seriously."
"Dont forget that in addition to being sexually abusive, Trump is a white supremacist. His team regularly borrows propaganda from white supremacist websites for its internet campaign. His current and former campaign managers have deep ties to officially recognized hate groups.  He is calling for ""poll watchers"" to guard against ""black voter fraud"".  While claiming the voting system is ""rigged"" he has tacitly affirmed those surrogates of his who have called for open violence in the event that he doesnt win. Trump's success has been largely due to an alarmingly intense tide of rabid white nationalism that is sweeping large parts of the mainland. Put that all together and I dont think it's an exaggeration to say we're approaching Kristallnacht territory with Trump. Lets please at least keep that ugliness out of Hawaii.

Be a conservative, fine. But if you are a decent person, dont vote for Trump. Maybe not right away, but eventually, you will be embarrassed, ashamed and regretful if you do"
"No, it will all end when we have true racial equality in this country and when blacks stop getting killed by law enforcement in extrajudicial killings, when there is no such thing as the KKK or Neo-Nazi's in our country, and when we have a President that will stop calling black protesters exercising their constitutional right of free speech ""SOB's"" and that they should be ""fired"" but calls KKK clansman, Neo-Nazi's and other white supremacist's ""fine people""."

Hello Toulouse.

There is an American book called ""Fundamentals of Criminal Justice: A Sociological View"", and on Page 69 of that book it is pointed out that 90.1 Percent of black murder victims were killed by black offenders (even though black folks make up only about 13 percent of the US population).

Got that, Toulouse? In the dangerous streets out there that you mention, a black person is about ten times more likely to be killed by a black killer than by a white killer. 

Would you like to run by us one more time how ""white privilege"" makes the mean streets a dangerous place for black folks?"
Why don't the Catholics move to Africa and the blacks move to Northen Ireland?  Then maybe we'd finally have a lasting peace.

"On January 20th, 2017 Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States and have to clean up Obama's mess.

And he will go on the speaking circuit internationally getting filthy rich badmouthing his own country and advocating one world government under the United Nations in order to save the planet from GLO-BULL warming"

That's the problem I have with Hollywood/Music types, they get told by their sycophantic peers they are smart and their brainwashed viewpoint must be told. Whatever, a white rapper seeking acceptance by a predominantly black and brainwashed peer group is not shocking.  Too bad the policies his 'side' advocates destroys the black middle class and insures poverty and violence every time."

We have a parliament that is disfunctional, full of career fools.  We have euthanasia, assisted suicide, and black lives matter.  What a bluidy mess.  This is no longer funny.  This country has become a collective disgrace.  That rests at the feet of our 'open', progressive society, and its lies.  Those who perpetuate these lies must be held accountable.

I'm guessing there were at least some number of players who didn't like or didn't agree with Obama. Did the team make sure those players got to show their unity? Its amazing after electing a black president twice and having black attorney generals for 8 years this country has more racial division than ever. So who's fault is that? Kap took a knee during Obama. What was Obama's response? The statistics don't lie - blacks kill blacks. Blacks kill police officers. Six police officers were shot in 3 different cities in August. What was the players response to that? The message is bogus - there are more successful blacks in this country than any other time. Check out Heather MacDonalds piece on nypost.com. Those are the real facts and the players are only serving to distract from them and the problems left by the Obummer presidency. You had the presidents full attention last weekend and instead of going to the table to discuss your protest you flip him the bird. Frauds!

"That was AFTER the Dallas shootings. Before the Dallas shootings, Obama was all about trying to excuse the violence in Baltimore and Ferguson. The executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations said this about Obama's wishy-washy rhetoric before the murders, ""It's a war on cops, and the Obama administration is the Neville Chamberlain of this war."" Did Obama condemn committed black nationalists? Nope. He blamed ""powerful weapons"". And that pillar of integrity Loretta Lynch doubled down, praising BLM and calling for more gun control and bringing up several shootings of blacks by cops. This comment will likely be ""rejected"" as my other perfectly civil comments criticizing Mr. Obama were, but it is the truth. Trump could have been stronger but the cherry picking is very hypocritical."
"I am grateful that Dr. Schill is taking racism, in all it's mutations, seriously. I got my degree from the UO despite the daily racism I experienced there. After 150 years, it is about time.

I would pity them if they didn't think killing black folks will make their lives better. All I want is equal protection under the law. White racism makes that goal impossible. It is more than a little ironic that the lady in black face is a law professor. You can't make this stuff up."

"Blacks are always suspect and can be shot on sight by police for mere suspicion of being armed. This happens in even open carry states. It happens hundreds of times a year nation wide. Many criminals get their guns by way of gun shows in red states, sometimes using ""straw"" purchasers. The NRA has helped facilitate these sales by fighting every gun control law. For example, most guns in Chicago are bought in Indiana where the gun laws are much more lax than in Chicago. BTW, The NRA even fights research into why we have so many gun deaths. The police live in  fear because they know there are enough guns in the population for every man, woman, and child."

What men like you don't like is that HRC has gonads and she's not to be trifled with. I cannot express how much I look forward to post-electionTrump--bent and emasculated by a woman. I think Trump can only save face through ritual self-destruction, but I digress.

But basically you are attacking those fighting state capture because you believe they are not doing it the intellectual way. The reality is that colonialism happened and apartheid happened. I can regale you with all the painful memories of living under apartheid but that will not change my life or the lives of many South Africans as it is now.  All I can do is to ensure that the current and future generations to not pay the price of corruption perpetrated under my watch. That is why I will support every initiative to stop state capture and ensure that the looters are behind bars where they belong."

"Regardless of the author's success or failure to convince you of it, the D Trump is ugely racist towards black people: he was found guilty of having taken measures to exclude black people from living in his buildings.  He said to a reporter that one of his black casino employees was lazy because ""laziness is a trait in blacks""  and any time he visited his casinos black employees were ordered off the floor.  Of course throughout his entire campaign he also kept the alt-right close at hand and exploited Obama's African heritage as grounds to question his birth certificate, encouraged violence against black protesters at his rallies.

Context matters -- she teaches in a professional school with a dearth of African American professors - perhaps if she worked among a more diverse faculty, the absurdity of her intention would have been apparent to her.

"""First prove your contention that a baker has to make a kkk cake.""
Your reply does it for me. In my state of California gay marriage bills have been defeated on every occasion (although I have voted in favor of them). It was made legal by a Federal judge not the will of the people. Therefore the argument can be made that gay marriage is offensive to most people. Therefore the contention that the KKK are offensive to most people becomes irrelevant. Therefore if the ACLU is successful in this case, all someone would have to do when the go to this black baker (just to be evil to him) is order a cake with the Grand Cyclops of the KKK on it...claim they were gay and therefore protected and watch with incredible glee as this black business owner has to submit...under the law...to decorate this Alt-Right guys cake with this heinous image on it.

She was clearly the nastiest candidate by decades of measurements.  

I am in favor of the death penalty for people who shove arrows into other people's brains after being released from the pen after being convicted of a different murder of a clerk. (That piece of slime happens to be white, but I don't care.)   If more of the convicted violent murderers are black than any other color, I don't care.  The black on black FBI statistics say  that is the case, and looking at the news from Portland, it appears to be true in Oregon at least.  If a black shoots a 6-year old girl in her bedroom in a drive-by shooting and happens to be black (like she is) I will be happy to push the button to end his life and save some other black person from being killed by him, ever.  Oregon turns loose murderers."
"I read this in Grade School - 4th grade I think in the 70's, and did not get it at all.

I believe all the talk about racism creates more racism- Let it go."

The reason is that American universities used to have VERY particular about giving tenure and one of the biggest things was a person's research and publishing.

I tell you no lies today."
"At present, charter schools are connected to public districts and under their control for content.  The voucher system may give them LESS money, and parents would have to pony up the rest.  Those who couldn't pay would be relegated to a cheaper, or public school. The voucher system is tailor-made for segregation- schools will be able to reject undesirable students, those special needs, Blacks, Latino, Korean, etc. students, and keep the school pure for 'our people'.  You're probably too young to remember the big increase in private schools in the wake of Brown vs. Board of Education.  Parents faced with integration looked for a way to keep their children from associating with 'undesirable Blacks' in the public schools.  And of course, they had the money to do it, and the private school industry boomed."
"So if I didn't want to sell cakes to black people, that's called the free market? Really???? They can get their cakes down the street at a bakery that will sell to black people. Religious beliefs?

The disproportionate amount of blacks in prison is not due to blacks being more criminal than whites. It is due to the entrenched racial bias throughout our criminal justice system. The war on drugs led to a 700 percent increase in our prison population since the late 70s and it was really a war on people of color doing drugs as study after study has shown.

He came out and boldly stated that the fatherless youth caused buy a  single Mom/many fathers culture was the biggest contributor to troubled communities. Of course, the politically correct media never embraced that truth - as clear as it might be for many of the actors - police, social workers, child welfare. It makes me want to scream and pull my hair out - that we refuse to help these communities and kowtow to racist groups like Black Lives Matter."
"""Why didn’t Abraham Lincoln deport all blacks back to Africa; after all, they were definitely illegals, weren’t they?""

Actually Abraham Lincoln favored sending them back to Africa.   

""Lincoln first proclaimed an interest in colonization during his eulogy for Henry Clay in 1852, when he admitted his allegiance to the esteemed Kentuckian's dual creed of gradual emancipation coupled with colonization. If slavery could be eliminated and the slaves returned to ""their long-lost fatherland,"" claimed Lincoln, ""it will indeed be a glorious consummation.""

""When Douglas tried to portray Lincoln as the friend of the blacks, Lincoln countered, as he did in a speech at Peoria, Illinois, by denying that he saw blacks as equals and by advocating the colonization of freed slaves in Liberia. Lincoln was aware, however, of the practical difficulties of such a program: ""If they were all landed there [Liberia] in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days,"" he stated."""
"Oh yes, MOVE was such a peaceful organization.

"The free-range lunacy of Donald Trump’s speech on Friday night in Alabama, where he referred to Colin Kaepernick—and other N.F.L. players who silently protest police brutality—as a “son of a bitch,” and of the subsequent Twitter tantrums in which the President, like a truculent six-year-old, disinvited the Golden State Warriors from a White House visit, illustrates that the passage of six decades has not dimmed this dynamic confronted by any prominent black person tasked with the entertainment of millions of white ones. 

Kaepernick began his silent, kneeling protest at the beginning of last season, not as an assault against the United States military or the flag but as a dissent against a system that has, with a great degree of consistency, failed to hold accountable police who kill unarmed citizens…"
"Total waste of time and yes under the radar this week, since the new tactic that Trump is a white racist. That one seems to be sticking a little better.

"Spewing hate is not helpful from any quarter.   However, I hope you don't think it hateful just that I disagree with your emphasis.   I have roots in the South and have great affection for my dead relatives who fought for the Confederacy.   However, I also despise the cause they fought for and the institution of slavery itself.

Most of the statues came along as the white supremacists (used to be southern Democrats now Republicans) wanted to cancel the progress of Reconstruction and enforce Jim Crow.  They rewrote a lot of our history to make sure that fair minded whites knew they would be violently accosted in the South (if they didn't keep quiet) and that blacks would keep their place or be assaulted, killed, or prevented from working or getting credit.

Those who wish to keep some of the statues as history could position a slave cabin next to the statue and have a historical marker explaining secession, treason, the institution of slavery, etc."

That's a rather broad claim, and I doubt that your source for same bothered to adjust for proportionality (read: take into consideration that blacks make up only 13% of the population).

https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-black-americans-commit-crime

While I'm on the topic of broad claims, can we stop saying ""fake news""? It is intellectually lazy in the extreme. A blanket condemnation of an entire profession is stupid.

Approach each news story as it comes and discredit it if you can, but journalism is about all we've got left to ride herd on these cowboys and girls."
"What about the police officers who shot and killed a 66 yr old blackwoman who held a baseball bat in her hands because she was mentally ill and that must have been a racist cop who did not think to use a taser first. Guess she wouldnt drop that bat? No! Now your telling people how to vote and THAT is rather unjustified. I forgot the state we all live in...the one that jumps from thinking blackface will increase racially motivated crimes or the ones that are trying to laugh this off or the ones who are actually ignorant. If your going to say that democrats are racist because they didnt choose the group who protected blacks now that gets OLD. Someone will allow somebody to say that republicans were also racists and that liberals are geared up towards allowing all things transgenered swing a bathroom door. VOTERS ARE FREE TO VOTE, SO WHATEVER."
"Based on what I learned about this kid he felt like he would stand on his right to carry and literally would shoot an officer down before letting them stop him.  As he said he refused to be ""kidnapped"" by police.  He would rather see a revolution (bloody as it were) because he feels that the only successful ones were the ones where there was blood shed.  

The problem is even if it were true and even if black ppl were oppressed, we can't have a civil war, other countries would see that as a weakness and come take us over just like that!  Officers being targeted come in every nationality so this isn't a white vs black showdown.  

Even if it was, the black community would lose.  Realistically speaking they'd be gunned down or blown up before winning any kind of civil war. 

I've been to the lower 48 my entire life I've seen how tense racial issues are down there.  Especially with those that fly the confederate flag. I've seen the dolls that some people have that express their feelings.."

"The Torys of England proved, once again, the failure of their ideological policies degenerating into racism and increased fascism throughout the nation.  Those left behind in the Tory deregulatory disaster are brainwashed into believing the problems are all caused by those nasty immigrants too brown or black in visage to be worthy of British citizenship.  Concurrent with our own national Torys(Republicans) whose descent into courting and appeasing the racists, fundamentalist christians, and corporate monopolists results in the nomination of a racist demagogue.  Corporate media stampedes the ignorant and stupid TV/Video generation into acquiecence for millions of dollars in ad revenue.  The American Demagogue's vitriol leads the headlines to cement his status as the Tory/Conservative ideal."
"It appears the main effect of Motor Voter registration is to register more people who don't care enough to make even the minor effort needed to vote.

This makes sense. If a person is not motivated to take the simple steps needed to register as a voter on their own, they are far less likely to vote, even when our state makes that so easy with mail-in ballots. In states that still require voters to go to the polls, these folks would be even less likely to make the effort to vote.

When Republicans who want to require voter ID to avoid potential voting fraud are accused of suppressing minority voters, I don't believe it. Registering and voting requires only a minor effort, but  if a person doesn't care enough to do the first, they probably aren't going to care enough to do the second. The arguments for why anyone can't do these simple things are just silly, and according to some blacks, racist.

"""Did I lie about the Democratic Party""

Yes you did. A lie of omission is still a lie. 

You're entire argument is that the segregationist faction of the Democratic party is alive and well within the party today. That's laughably false, a rote repetition of propaganda and revisionist history. 

Abraham Lincoln once argued that slavery shouldn't be abolished outright. He also once proposed shipping all slaves to the island of Madagascar, & quite plainly spoke out against allowing black people to intermarry or vote. By your logic, all Republicans hold the same position today because it was once held in the past. It's asinine. 

Your 'respectfully' comments are just window dressing. If you respected yourself or sincere debate, you could express that through action by not sharing such facile thoughts with others. A waste of everyone's time. You might as well argue the color of the sky."
What you are asking for is complete accommodation in the name of freedom of choice regardless of the social mores of the country. Are you ok with a black person wearing a dog collar attached to a leash held by a white person? A minuscule minority may like the idea but it's horrendous to most. Wearing a burqa is precisely that.

A few are there because they pose a serious threat to others.  Most are there because Americans still don't get it when it comes to respecting fellow humans.  Those who expend energy on the dead Deady issue, apparently have no problem with the enslavement of so many, this time in cages where every action including excrement is monitored and controlled.  The blindness of the many to current atrocities and the focus on those past that no one can do anything about is so representative.  We still do not respect our fellows.

CBC's cross-country host posed  a really interesting question today, 'why dont white people talk to their children about race'?  Its a question we all need to ponder.

On being uncomfortable, I read an apposite comment somewhere recently - 'the harm done to white feelings are not equal to the harm done to black bodies.  Help or get out of the way'.  More food for thoughtful thought...not kneejerk reactions and whataboutisms."
Football is destroying itself.  Not by the players who chose to protest against Blacks being slaughtered by our police but by the constant pursuit of profits by the NFL.

"his legacy includes that racist beating of that white kid by four black thugs. They did believe they had every right  to rip their bloodlust vengeance on that challenged kid because Obama told them they were not now and never are at fault, and white people always and forever  are."
"The police shoot a disproportionate number of black people. Our amateurish and trigger-happy police do it in circumstances where they would not shoot a white person. This particular instance is possibly not one of those instances, but the fact remains. I suggest if it bothers you when the press reports on black people getting shot, don't read these stories."
There were children dip. The morality of the republicans is punish brown and black kids and excuse white hoods.
where's the riots.......oh yeah - it was a black on white crime....ho hum.
"irt Hilo.   After all what living in America having being a part of his acomplishments to this day he's still not satisfied with what he's gotten being an American, complaining having a foreign ""black"" taking away a ""black"" American role. Being of Black Heritage he'll always use that to complain, at times and instances I believe he has the right to do that. Reminds me of Michelle saying, for the first time in my Life... . Even if in a great position they'll always use that racial line of defense no matter what because of being on the short end of the stick racial wise. It's their escape and reason to complain. 

No need to complain ""only"" as a Black American Actor being shunned but should have said American Actors being shunned. Why use ""black"" race?"
"When flames are thrown, I throw them back, just like you do.  And those men are conservatives to me but Uncle Tom's to you.  And all blacks are tokens or prizes on the Democratic Plantation."
"If an offensive flag is a headline, why isn't it that nearly all interracial murder is black-on-white and that blacks commit the largest per capita rate of hate crimes?

This endless politically-motivated coverup of racial dirt in this country helps nobody. You're only willing to say negative things about groups if they're white and Christian."
"So...alleged racism against African Americans matters, but racism against Serbs does not?

You are aware that many blacks are racist against whites.....are you?"
Thats because their knowledge if firearms is diddly. To them anything black is threatening. The ignorance is astounding if not pathetic.
"So true. It's not like Trump's chief strategist ran ""the platform for the alt right"" or that Trump himself consistently adopted and retweeted racist images and messages generated on white supremacist message boards or that Trump himself consistently barred black people from living in his buildings or that Trump himself repeatedly described black people as intrinsically lazy. No, there's absolutely no hint of evidence that Trump is any more of a White Supremacist than your average joe goebbels."
they do not want to give his race or color normally people with the last name white are black and people with the last name black are white so I think it was a black man could be wrong but there is a 70% to 30% chance I am right.
"Quite simply, you are wrong.  

The NFL is losing viewers at a record pace for two straight years--the same timeframe as the nation-hating protests.  ESPN is losing 15,000 viewers per day.  Papa Johns will soon be joined by many other companies who want their sponsorship money back for the incompetence displayed by the NFL leadership.

And finally, your racism is showing when you claim something as asinine as ""when all else fails, blame the black people"" nonsense.  He never mentioned race.  Why did you?"
"Billions of dollars in drug evidence money missing? Sexual harassment of female officers? Murder because a motorist was black? Racial profiling? NO folks none of the above.

"Speaking of third swings and misses, this is the third black woman that Trump has tried to smear.

The old white supremacist just can't stand black people in power, especially black women.

When they said Trump was empty, vindictive, shallow, impatient, incompetent and morally small,

they were only scratching the surface of the hellscape of Trump's depraved and degenerate character."
"This article does include Nation of Islam: ""In reality, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and any adherents to a racist, segregationist ideology are scum; they should be condemned. So too should the Nation of Islam and the radical fringes of the Black Lives Matter movement who adhere to ideologies just as racist and supremacist."""
"Yes, Trump's illegal anti-black housing discrimination was well known. And the ""law and order"" party voted for him anyway. Because at best, breaking the law to commit discrimination against black Americans doesn't bother you. The GOP needs to stop throwing around the word ""freedom"" because you chose a man to lead the country who repeatedly, ILLEGALLY took away freedom of Americans for no other reasons than the color of their skin. He put his racism to work. He backed his belief in segregation with ACTION, not just words. It's not an accident that neo-
Nazi Richard Spencer and Klansman David Duke and the international white supremacist movement were so passionate and enthusiastic about Trump. Talk all you want about George Lincoln Rockwell in the past, but you are arm in arm allies with the neo-Nazis and the KKK today.

And you guys wonder why 94% of black people vote against your deplorable racist party."
"That you are confused about Black Lives Matter is not anyone else's problem. It's your own. No one said other lives do not matter. They simply said that black lives indeed do matter, contrary to popular racist opinion. As for your thinly veiled reference to women and abortion--most men support abortion rights which help men not only to be inconvenienced but also to not be required to pay child support for 21 years. Bill, I realize you're old, but many old guys are able to keep up with the times. Those who cannot should refrain from commenting in order not to look like a fool."
"Why is it that white people have to feel guilty for slavery and not black people? A greater percentage of free blacks owned slaves than whites. Was it ok for free blacks to own slaves? The first slave owner in America was a black man. The new world slave trade was an expansion of the slave trade in Africa run by black muslims. Why are they asking money from whites and not blacks? After all, it was a black man that brought slaves here."

Your man Satoshi also publicly proclaimed that Black women are the least attractive group among all humans.    As a result, the largest student organization in London (representing 120,000 students) unanimously called for Kanazawa's dismissal from your London school.

"I treat people like people and judge them on how they treat others. What shall I do, Charles, lay down my coat for a black person to walk upon? Let the (black) person in line behind me go ahead? I wouldn't do that for most people.
Black people complaining about ill treatment, but then not finishing high school, for instance (same for white people) won't fix a thing. Bill Cosby, whom I've lost respect for, made a searing speech that hit it spot on. Also the monologue at the end of Madea's Family Reunion by Cicely Tyson. Powerful stuff. Check it out."
"The topic de jour is 'colonialism'. Helen Zille is pilloried by the hypocrites within her own party for making a silly remark about it. The modern colonialists are the Guptas, arrivals from abroad who successfully colonized the minds and pockets of their willing subjects, the black politically connected elite. The ones who complain most about colonialism and white on black racism, have the least to say about how easily they were bought, enslaved and traded by the new Indian colonialists."

In the US there is an 800% greater risk of being shot by fellow Black dudes than by cops. Black gays have to decide for themselves whose protecting their best interests: BLM or general society of which cops are part. Most choose the latter but they are cast aside in the hysteria of the vocal radicles who claim to speak for everybody.
"A person has a right to protest on their own time and on their own dime. Call the customers racist bigots? Free speech doesn't extend to private concerns. The complete hypocrisy of the NLF Union is equally laughable and pathetic. The NFLPU doesn't support protests against domestic violence, CTE, fathering children out of wedlock, using PEDs, income inequality, or racist statements such as the ""Black Power"" salutes the NFL players so frequently provide. 

The lowest paid NFL rookie players ($465K) make 8 times the median household income in the U.S. In 2015, the median salary was $860K per year. Virtually every NFL player attended college on athletic scholarships. They have zero student loan debt. NFL players live a life of absolute privilege because ""privilege"" is based on economic power. NFL players insipid racism is reflected in their vitriolic hatred of the U.S. The very country that has bestowed so much prosperity, education, and opportunities they revile. Sound about right?"
I agree. I want a black female to play Queen Elizabeth. Or an Asian actor to play Hamlet. Or an Indian actor to play Romeo.
"Your tired of hearing about it because you don't suffer prejudice for being white in Eugene.   

Your idea of us freeing skates oot of good will is absurd.   It was for profit and justified because black people were considered inferior and not entitled to normal civil law.   You carry the same junk I heard in Texas.  Nice slave owners doing a favor by treating slaves as pets, to be bred and sold.

You don't care about black lives you can't see.  You put blacks in a world of your imagination.

I do agree that talking about it gets old and those areas of high violence must be have safety restored.  We need walking police, to live and work on those neighborhoods.  We have to stop lying about opportunity and create jobs and give them a school that south Eugene would be proud of.

There's plenty of ways to open opportunity for all Americans 0f low income.

"This is the kind of hate crimes that Donald Trump has given rise to.  In fact, shortly after this occurred a member of the mosque was taped saying that this was because of Trump, but this was not mentioned in this article. 
Hate crimes against Muslims, blacks and other visible minorities have skyrocketed throughout North America because the man in the White House who has given them license to do so. The very day the world is sent into chaos because of Trumps Muslim ban from 7 countries that the Cato Inst. says are responsible for 0 American deaths (but excludes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE who are responsible for hundreds / thousands of American deaths because  Trump  has businesses there)  this tragedy occurs.

"Remember the big muscular cop that worked at a school and threw a slightly built young black lady and her desk across the room? And for the horrible crime of refusing to hand over her cell phone! I had a lady, whom I used to admire; try to justify the violent assault on that child by that cop. I know damn well if it had happened to one of her grandchildren she would have moved heaven and earth to get that cop fired and punished.

"Because you have no defense for your party who nominated then voted for and still capes for the best friend white supremacy and anti-black bigotry has had since George Wallace. You have no defense for willingly voting for then defending an anti-black racist. You can talk about civility all you want, but the fact you chose a segregationist to lead the nation does the talking for you. Racism isn't civil, regardless of the number of times you say ""respectfully"" and ""polite"". Racism is disrespectful. Racism is rude. Racism is divisive. Racism is exclusionary. Racism is anti-liberty

""Segregation now, segregation tomorruh, segregation forevah."" Remember those words from the segregationist George Wallace? People in the 60s were smart enough to keep that segregationist off the top of the ticket. But Republicans in 2016 were happy to nominate, elect, and defend a segregationist. Coat it in all the sugar you want. Racism is vile and everybody knew Trump is steeped in it. GOP embraces him though"

The ""real time version"" is the honest truth.

No knife is seen.  No ""threat"" (other than the officer's) is heard.

You're the one ""picking another scenario,"" not Black Lives Matter.

The footage available seems edited.  We don't have footage from all of the body cameras.  Is it simply a coincidence that, out of the last twenty shootings of unarmed blacks, the only one officer fired and charged was the one caught dead to rights on third party video?

He claimed EXACTLY what these officers claim.  But the video shows him shooting a black man in the back and planting a taser next to the body.

Now, that's ""the real time version."""
"Would any black person walk(ing) in a white neighbourhood at night reach home before being racially abused or attacked? I assume, thomasm and Steven, that you are comfortable with this generalization? To 'strive for a united nationality...' begins with small things such as you both having to recognize your tone. I was also hoping you would stand up to Les Eberhardt who insists that every neighbourhood (whatever that means) inhabited by black people is a violent cesspool. However, if that is the attitude you have about how black people live, then it should come as no surprise that as racial groups our paths are diverging."

Here are a few facts which will hurt you for a moment... but if you open your head and turn from the leftist propaganda, this will help you understand the real problem.

**The FBI's crime data show that, in 2015, a police officer was 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male was to be killed by a police officer. Black males have made up 42 percent of all cop-killers over the last decade, though they are only 6 percent of the population.**

Here is one good article on it-- there are countless others.  You're wrong and that is the simple truth.  Please get educated... the real problem awaits your help in solving.

"Yeah, Zimmerman stalked the kid, followed Trey all over, who had every rghht to be there, as he lived right nearby where Trey was walking home. Ximmy wrongly accused the kid of being a criminal thug. Trey's only arrest, ever, was for possessing weed, no other stuff, not a gangster. Just a nice teen, a little high on weed, walking home from his prom. Zimmerman, by contrast, now has a long rap sheet of domestic violence, hit his bride, and busted for assault at nightclubs & elsewhere, very violent. He killed a black teen, only as a racist idiot, who thought he, Zimmy, was a neighborhood watch hero, which he was expelled from for his being a loose cannon. Too bad Trey defended himself, against big Z, otherwise he might have managed to stay alive, had he surrendered to this nutjob. It isn't fair that a high on weed teen who otherwise got good grades, had a nice girlfriend, and would have majored in something good in college gets killed by a psycho, now worshipped by far right racists."
"More whites are killed-- even as a proportion of their representation in the populace-- than blacks. If you know HOW to read, Heather McDonald's book, ""The War on Cops"" breaks down the statistic I just mentioned. And yes, there are national statistics broken down by race. Blacks only need to obey the instructions of the police officer they come into contact with, and they will stay alive. But no, they fight with cops, display guns, try to take cops' guns, or run AFTER displaying a gun, all of which give the a police officer authority to use deadly force. But truth to a liberal is like Kryptonite to Superman."
Living fear of out of control black crime is not egalitarian either.

They are. But there was always a method to this filthy, racist madness:

2. Claim falsely that Obama was a Muslim -- forcing him to deny that he was a Muslim with the awkward (and utterly false) implication that being a Muslim is somehow a bad thing.
3. Demand Obama's academic transcripts because after all a black man could not have gone to, still less done well at, Harvard Law School.

"this woman, who apparently lives in her own little bubble, reminds me of how really dumb people can be.... is she not aware of the deep seated black racism that is running rampant in the US? instead of concentrating on setting up phony arguments for banning certain words that accurately describe certain people, how about concentrating on how morons are pushing the idea that if you are white, you should be ashamed? 
personally, I would prefer our Western world where white people have advanced our society to its current level to the societies in Africa or the Middle East where women are treated like sh*t, gays are thrown off of buildings, Christians are hunted down and killed, men hide their women under rags and bugger little boys as sexual compensation, etc. etc. etc.
The hypocrisy of coddled dolts like this woman who attack anyone who does not agree with bending over and giving in to dumb ideas advanced by morons BUT ignores worse atrocities is pretty useless."
"This is the nature of America's racist fascist state of mind. The black-as-criminal image has been with us at least since the nineteenth century, when explicit racism portrayed African American slaves’ essential nature as ignorant and savage, in need of the “civilizing” influence of the white man.  At that time little black crime actually occurred, as slaves’ lives were rigorously controlled, and they could be and often were swiftly put to death for perceived offenses against the slave owners, who acted as judge, jury, and executioner.  As Chief Justice Roger B. Taney said in the famous 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision about the Founding Fathers’ mindset in drafting the Constitution:

Blacks had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit. He was bought and sold and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic, whenever profit could be made by it."
Black Lives Matter is one of the biggest racist groups out there...according to this he claims to be a member.

Similarly, when I said that your equating practising homosexuals with blacks was tantamount to accusing the latter of being sinners, you never responded.
I have also noticed that you don't seem to pick up nuances in comments; if one is not for something then you automatically assume they are against it. When posters try to explain you have no time for subtle difference and nuanced arguments. You just label them all ‘liars’."

Given the Democrat party's unapologetic racist history and poor performance for black people, it really makes you wonder why on earth they want to be associated with this party. 

Yet the Denver Post and liberal media want to try to imply that Trump is somehow a racist because he can't attend an NAACP meeting. What a bunch of liars and hypocrites we have on the left."
"Gee Mot, you must shut your eyes to reality. You know, I seem to remember that the ACA passed, and R's in Congress didn't managed to send Obama to jail. Isn't that what you remember? Also, Trump disrespects the flag regularly, in public, while at the same time calling pro athletes traitors for refusing to stand for the national anthem, in order to bring public attention to police mistreatment of black people, a first amendment right the players have along with the president. So what message is Trump promoting when he disrespects the flag? Maybe that he's the prez, and he can do anything? Trump is ignoring California, which just suffered a hugely costly, deadly inferno, because he doesn't like California. Puerto Rico? Those losers don't even vote, why bother? His solution to his Benghazi in Nigeria? Ignore the dead soldiers, pretend it didn't happen. Lie some more about Obama ignoring dead soldiers? Why not, Trump has been lying about Obama for years.

I think that is a purposeful mischaracterization of someone who seems like a decent guy.

Or this, ""One thing is sure, however: White people aren’t going to go around shooting blacks because of it."" That seems like a naive statement given the history of violence against blacks. One can hope, but ""sure""? I'm not sure.

EVERY culture has had slavery.  Do some research.  As to Affirmative Action...how about we end that boondoogle, along with all welfare and social justice programs?  They are, after all unconstitutional.  As to work ethic...blacks have double the unemployment rate as whites...due primarily to lack of education/training/experience.

"Yes, racism. I'm sure you're aware of the voter suppression history of the Republican party in the South. 

Voter suppression, targeted at blacks, Latinos and the poor, has been a weakness of the Republican party  since Strom Thurmond switched from Dem. to Rep. in 1964 and the rest of the segregationists followed. That is well documented and the unfortunate reality that the R. party has to work on. 

Using words like ""jungle"", ""ape"", ""monkey""....that's a wolf whistle to the white elitists and we weren't born yesterday. Time to knock that crap off.

And as far as Obama...when did he accuse racial bias when it wasn't warranted by a preponderance of statistics and evidence? 

I mean, do you believe that racism exists? That it is a problem? What about climate change? The moon landings?

I'm not aware of ""shenanigans"" that have been pulled in open primaries. Can you cite some? 

I know that Putin had 1000's of fake news stories alleging this sort of thing. Putin likes closed primaries too."
"No, it is like refusing to allow a racist to sell because he refuses to sell to blacks. That is the proper analogy, not your straw man."
"Have they declared BLM and Antifa hate groups with gang affiliations yet?  No?  Awww.

Why can't whites have a group, but it's okay for blacks??"
"To the defenders of Trump, that 'he hires black people (Ben Carson, Omarosa)' is like the usual phrase when talking about homosexual or racial issues: I have gay friend, I have black friend, used as a shield of some sort.  It means very little.  What speak volume is his actions.  His actions, as listed in this article, show that he is a racist and a basic bigot - product of the time/era during his formative years and he has not progressed since.  Now shamelessly using race to divide the country just to strengthen his base is a crime against this country."
"What a silly post.  Your picture of Blacks in the South ""laughing and singing"" and honoring the ""Old South"" of slavery and segregation is laughable.  To be sure, over decades of slavery and segregation, Blacks learned (many of them ""the hard way"") to stay ""in their place"". To passively accept Second Class Citizenship, to drink from the ""Colored Only"" drinking fountain, to sit ""in the back of the bus"", to accept being called ""N##@@"" or ""boy"", to attend inferior, segregated schools, to be unable to eat in restaurants or stay in hotels, and all the other indignities that racial discrimination inflicted on them.  Oh, yes, Earl, they really ""fly that Confederate flag"" in memory of those wonderful years.  What an insulting post.  

The gas station?  Guess what, sometimes living with integrity and honoring human values is  bit inconvenience.  Personally, I'll run out of gas before I'd buy gas from a racist.  What you do is your business, What Mr. Dalton, I or anyone else chooses to do is ours"
"You are mistaken.  When you are a black person, complying and doing everything right, is not a guarantee that you will leave the incident on the outside of a body bag.  Have you not been paying attention AT ALL??!?"
How is the President encouraging police to shoot and kill black who are unarmed?
"Blacks and Jews are similar. As soon as there's any perceived injustice, the race and anti-semite cards go flying."
"There is a big difference between the groups you mention and today’s militant white supremacist, fascist and new Nazi groups. Groups like Black Lives Matter, and some of the Muslim groups you mention are almost all seeking equal treatment because they feel they are discriminated against and not getting equal treatment. For some of the groups, their message hardly sounds like hate or racial superiority over other groups. They are not segregationists or separatists who believe in white privilege, domination, and American “homelands” for whites only. The white supremacists and Nazi groups like the ones rallying in Charlottesville preach hate and inferiority of blacks, Jews, and non-whites who should be deprived of rights, deprived of government benefits except those paid for by black taxes in black communities, forced to live apart from whites, and not entitled to the superior position and entitlements of whites in our country and society."
"This issue will go away the moment we stop the police from murdering unarmed black people. Murdering unarmed black people may be part of white America's patriotic heritage, but it violates the Constitutional rights of the dead and their loved ones, in the 21st century. On the odd occasion that the courts find the killings unjustified, the police usually keep their jobs and pensions. They get time off with pay and counseling to recover from being a murderer. The tax payers pay the dead peoples loved ones. The cop that killed 12 year old Tamir Rice playing with a toy air rifle in a public play ground lost his job for lying on his job application. Killing a black 12 year old after less than 10 seconds of the cop's arrival was okay. There is video. All lives have never mattered in the USA. I guess killing black children is patriotic for some white folks. They are easier and safer to kill than unarmed black teens and adults. The children almost never fight back."
"No, you are wrong. Immigration as the Democrat party designed it is to replenish the democrat voting roles.

If the 3rd World immigrants flooding the USA voted conservative, the democrats would be wailing to shut it down.

We need limited immigration, and it must be based upon merit, and what immigrants are best for the USA.

There are 400,000 South African whites of mainly Dutch and British heritage who are being systematically discriminated against in South Africa. They are living in shanty towns, because they can't get work. They are also being murdered by black South African thugs, just because they are white. 

This group would be the best immigrants we could get. They would fit in well with the traditional American ethnicity.

And, we could shut down Muslim immigration to allow these South African whites to immigrate here."
"The DP has posted at least a dozen separate stories about this incident so far.

In April, when a Muslim black man in Fresno shot and killed three random white men on the street because he hates white people, the DP posted a grand total of three stories - and one of those was actually a story about gunfire sensors used by the police. 

I wonder why there's such a disparity in the amount of coverage."
"Don't cry ""reverse racism"" or make false equivalencies. Context matters. Saying whiteface is the same as blackface trivializes historical oppression (hello, black folks were not the slave owners/lynchers/Jim Crow enforcers). People of color are forced to assimilate themselves to the mainstream white culture in order to survive; putting on a ""white face"" is something we must do every day.  When a white person dons black face, they are trying on the face of the marginalized other for fun without living or experiencing racism. Not to mention the historical context of blackface. Google it."
"At least four anti-black, anti-poor Cabinet members. Is this how T-rump is going to have ""95% of the blacks supporting him""???

The lunatics are taking over the asylum."
"In the 1950s, the people running the country were white, Christian, straight males. Since then, women, non-whites and gays have all gained significant power. ""Christian values"" no longer automatically hold sway. So naturally many white, Christian, straight males feel things are worse. No longer do they feel the same sense of superiority. That's what ""Make America Great Again"" means to them -- put things back the way they were, so women, blacks, gays are all inferior to us again."
"Sure.  Donald Trump is elected on a campaign that began and ended with exploiting his supporters' intense dislike of Mexicans and muslims . . . and right-wingers call this black lawyer a ""race-baiter."""
"The folks that elected Trump would be quite happy to go back to the horse and plow days as long as they got back the white privileges they had in the 1950's too. They are defined by who they fear, hate, and resent, nothing aspirational. In the 21st century, they even get convicted of murder for just killing black folks praying in church. That would never happen in the 1950's. These days the ""poorly educated"" just don't fair well."
"We'll see if President-elect Biff has followed tax laws, but what we do know is that he's a narcissistic sociopathic sex predator who has slimed his way to the top using the media brilliantly to smear everyone on all sides and dupe us into the false equivalency of comparing his lifelong lies and crimes to the mostly untrue and/or mostly minor errors of the Clintons.

Undocumented workers in the U.S. commit crimes at a *lower rate* than U.S. citizens. The IRS is *independent* of the executive branch (and the Clintons) in all but the most conspiratorial FOX-addled brains. The lawful election was won by two million in total votes by Hillary, so Clownstick has *no real mandate*. The ""leftist mobs"" are a *tiny fraction* of those expressing their horror of this lowlife racist creep, and the deplorable holes and trolls he will now enable.

These are all facts. But it's the age of Trump. Semi-literate, and semi-sane trolls ""no"" in their gut that the first black president is a Kenyan Muslim."
"There are very smart Black people who will join people of other races to boycott these jock clowns - without an audience and people buying their promotional stuff, just like the NFL they will no longer be a profit to own or know. Schools will lose donations etc.

Just watch. Many people have little respect for these often brainless jocks who think they are gods because they can dunk or throw a ball:) 

Adios! IDOLATRY that The LORD GOD hates! worshiping these folk is idolatry!"
"Critty, ""Obama's only contribution to the rise of the White Nationalist ""movement"" was the coincidence that he happened to be black.""  ""The problem here is white racism against non-whites. Plain and simple.""  Are you saying Trump is a problem for being coincidentally white?"
"Just incase you're curious about Breitbart's history: they used to post much more inflammatory articles. They had a banner section called ""Black Crime"" (as if to imply that only black people commit crimes), and Milo Yiannopoulos used to routinely opine about how women should not be in the workplace. Really awful crap. Now, they have pivoted to publishing less dramatic material (they'll often just repost an AP story that they think their readers can get worked up about), but they rely on their comments section to do the work. I challenge you to scroll through a comments section in Breitbart and not find someone professing that we should commit genocide against blacks or Muslims, or else threatening politicians and journalists with rape and murder. Breitbart doesn't *need* to write awful stuff anymore, in order to be America's leading site for the radicalization of white nationalist terrorists. I will continue to work assiduously to shut it down."
"I don't go that far.  I don't see it as a stupid charade!  Just like I wouldn't say ""the charade of pretending to be Christian while ignoring a clear mandate of Jesus"" to describe the other side.  It's not black and white.  It's nuanced.  People can differ, and Amoris seems to be saying let's make a good faith effort to follow the teaching, albeit with pastoral mercy..."
One useless individual showing his true nature of a black soul without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  A blight on the Comments section spouting hatred and violence as the basic tenet of evil.
Yawn........I think the church is buying into the BLM narrative where whites are blamed for choices other people make. There is no conspiracy against blacks and most of the racism I have seen is towards whites not the other way around. If the BLM movement are concerned about the many deaths of their race then they need to stop killing each other.......there is the problem.....not with whites. I am white privilege and will be here anytime someone wants to blame me for their poor life choices.
"What do you know, another Democratic Party / Liberal false lying story designed to foster racism,division and anger as well as draw the ignorant to the Democratic Party. Kind of like ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" ..... it just didn't happen. When are blacks going to wise up and see they're being flat out used and enslaved by the Democratic Party."
"Hillarp is right on.  Succinct and accurate.  I'm not sure why someone has to point out the obvious but if that's the limit your acumen, so be it.  Now I understand.  As for you claiming the article states that the second amendment has its roots in slavery, that's a bit of a stretch, isn't it.  Fairly hypocritical of you to talk about attacking rather than responding.  Pot.  Kettle.  Black.  Lol."
"The topic is that even impoverished Gambia can have a relatively quick and successful transition of power while the supposedly mature democracy of the USA cannot.

The fascist designs of the left wing Democrats, the grievance industry hustlers, other parasites feeding greedily at the public trough and, the low information useful idiots they enlist to round out their crowds are busy derailing democracy.  

Only 2 cabinet members have been approved, the press is busy lying about Trump, the new White House and its plans and actions so far, and Schumer and others are getting rev'd up to delay, defang or defeat everything the new administration promised to do.

This should be condemned by real democrats everywhere.

It reminds me of 1968 when blacks in Watts ""taught whitty a lesson"" by looting, vandalizing and burning down the stores and businesses in their own neighbourhoods.

P.S. I'd lecture you to stick to topics but since you have nothing to contribute anyway it doesn't really matter."

"Well I fully expect the Liberals to throw the black woman under the bus after using her to pretend they support female candidates and nominate the white man, born in Pakistan, like they usually do in a winnable riding."
"When cops kill the ""mentally ill"" and cops kill African-Americans that's called justified self-defense. But when Nazis demonstrate and blow off a lot of hot air that's called hate. Let's face it - those tagged ""mentally ill"" are one of society's most hated scapegoats, along with the homeless, addicts, the indigenous, and the poor in general.
  The difference between Nazis hatred of blacks and Jews and society's hatred of the ""mentally ill""? One is sanctioned by society, the other is merely a lot of blustering hot air that society exploits to scare people."
"Your comments apply in the absence of objective first person witnesses.  If force was used in an attempt to put the woman in the truck and this was seen by objective third party witnesses then evidence exists if for nothing else then disturbing the peace or some other charge.  On the other hand, if the ADA was overreaching with a an attempted kidnapping charge when there were only some words exchanged, it all makes sense.  After all the man was black and we know how the system treats black men if given a chance."
"There's a certain amount of hysteria over abortion which can lead to romanticizing over some principle, but hating the poor black person the child would probably become."
"Per Table 43 the probability of a black committing any type of crime: murder, rape, robbery, burglary, embezzlement, vehicle theft is much higher than any other ethnic group.

Asians are the most law abiding.  

No category for hispanics.

American Indians commit crimes roughly in proportion to their numbers as a % of the population.

Blacks, by far, are much more likely to commit a crime per table 43."
"And the ""higher percentage"" of blacks and Latinos happened because the vote was way down.  Trump received less raw minority votes than Romney did."
"The methods that BLM employed in this situation were disgusting. Pride caving to it, almost more so. It is neither anti gay nor anti black to say that. Enough with this PC ""can't criticize him or her because they are part of a marginalized group"" nonsense. I both support equal rights for all people, and support Pride (or I did support Pride before this embarrassment)."
"His base is comprised of white supremacists, racists, ooga booga tribalists, and other extremists who use rhetoric to incite violence. The Republican party's modus operandi has been and remains the use of extremist rhetoric to inspire acts of violence against designated groups--women seeking reproductive medical care, Americans who are Muslim, poor people, African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, etc. This type of activity has a long history in the Republican party."
"So to prove your racist credentials I have rewritten your post
Sad...95% of the of Trump's staff are white and living high off the hog but feel they need to protest against oppression while causing oppression themselves.  I believe, in general, black people, as well as other races are in our country are not out to get them.  They, including this white person, are just tired of their violence, petty grievances, constant complaining, blind solidarity, and double standards.  In all honesty, we were on track into healing as a country and putting racism behind us.  Unfortunately someone came along and started stoking the coals again....
Pretty interesting, huh?  You are such a racist."
"They also said it's about the Flag.

""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told reporters."
The writer needs to quit using black as her excuse. I personally talk to black people less and less. Black people seem to be waiting to find something wrong with white people to perpetuate their myth that all their problems are white people . She should worry more about her own country killing other blacks because of racism and bigotry before she attacks white culture which had the vision and brains too create a country like Canada that she was welcomed to.
"So you just had to go there and bring the Fairbanks 4 into the mix huh?  For your information not all Natives hate the police like not all Black people hate the police, like... Well you get my drift.  So I stand with the police on this matter.  I too find it despicable that the police officer was shot and almost lost his life.  I can assure you that ""Activist's"" will not be standing up for this guy but good try anyways, now go have a long look in the mirror and tell yourself to be a better person instead of stirring the pot of racial hatred."
"Yes, white people.  The Left tars us all with the same brush, supremacists or not, in the same way they blame Trump for everything and excuse all other actors for their violence and crimes.  Do you think BLM and NBP are only opposed to White supremacists?  If so, better think again, especially if you are Jewish like Schatz because the Panthers think Blacks are the chosen people and Jews are imposters."
"Dam right Goodall should get involved.
Whites have faced increasing discrimination since affirmative action legalized suppression all races except black!"
"And the Repube's are putting together a secret bill which will harm their base the most; the angry, old, stressed out, high blood pressure, white guys, who spent the previous 8 years disparaging the black man in the White House with with racist, hateful, fake news, spewing across the inter-web."
"You said of black Americans and Hispanic Americans: ""They're Democrats because the Welfare System pays them to be, so they put their financial interests ahead of their religious beliefs.""

Now you're saying that 78% of black Americans support welfare so they don't have to pay for the remaining 22%. As if all black people know each other. As if every black family has friends, relatives and neighbors who are on welfare. You realize, don't you, that you're admiting that you don't have any black friends or neighbors, right? Otherwise, by your logic, you'd be forced to vote Democratic so you wouldn't have to pay for your black neighbors. See how daft that logic is? Because one can't have any issue except welfare if one knows any black people according to your logic. So ergo, you don't know any black people. LOL. Keep digging, Cliven, keep 'splainin' what you know about ""teh negro"", and keep wondering why black Americans see through the white supremacist charade that is the modern GOP."
Bennet needs to wear a body cam at all times and install cams into and outside his house and car. Trouble is black people give themselves a bad name and nice guys like Bennet suffer for it. What can they do to reverse this? You tell me.
"Yes. Seriously. Race.

Trump refused to rent to black Americans. Trump retweets white supremacists. Trump stated that a judge wasn't fit to preside over his Trump University fraud case because Judge Curiel is of Mexican ancestry. Trump ran a years long birther campaign. Trump called Barack Obama a racist. Trump is so deep in his projection that he even called Bryant Gumbel racist. By ""called"" of course I mean ""tweeted"" since Trump doesn't have the sack to make these accusations to people's faces.

Did you think David Duke, Richard Spencer and the global neo-Nazi movement were drawn to Donald Trump because of his reality TV career, his foreign-manufactured ties, his bankruptcies, his repeated stiffing of his blue collar contractors, or his many twitter opinions about Katy Perry's love life?"

"Who introduced race into this discussion thread?

A lot of black folks refuse to hear the truth, that black people commit crimes too and need to be punished for those crimes. That some black people, like some people of other races, are downright stupid and/or violent.  You don't get to play the ""I'm black"" card and expect people to overlook your faults.

""When did white racism stop effecting public policy?"" You meant ""affecting"" but I suppose I'm racist for pointing that out (assuming you are black as you claim to be).

""... white racism embedded in virtually all of our public policies."" Yeah, we keep waiting for just one example of public policy in Eugene, Lane County, Oregon, or the U.S., let alone an example of ""virtually all."""
"Rogan, I like reading your opinions. Don't always agree but still read them. Sorry, you fumbled the ball on this one. By the way 2 more teams did it this afternoon. Tell me the difference between staying in or sitting down?
 And not one word in your opinion piece of why these protests even started. You made yourself sound just like a well to do white guy who has no Idea what it is like to be black, and think there is no difference in how blacks and whites are treated. 
  I think you're the one showing a sad ignorance. And Trump is the face of our nation now. Good or bad"
That is the idea.   Also some blacks have been exacting revenge for almost as long.   There have been atrocities on both sides.
"The problem is that 6% of the population is responsible for 50% of the violent crime. White people get shot by cops too. I don't think we have a white privilege problem, we have a black crime problem."
"How is ""judicial diversity"" even a thing? How did we, as a country, get to the point where appointing judges becomes an exercise in political correctness? That the first, last and only consideration for these positions should be merit. If I'm standing before a court, I don't want the most diverse judge, I want the best judge. Man, woman, black, white, bright green freaking aliens for all I care. Results should be what we care about, not how the judge is ""packaged"", or ""labeled"".

"Eric benefited from white privilege. He was assumed to be innocent. If he were black, he would have been profiled."
"I didn't judge you, just your defense of the indefensible. What I know about you is that you think my being offended by a black face costume is worse than the actions that I am offended by.  You think someone offended should immediately offer forgiveness and understanding for harmful deeds if there is a plausible reason for the offensive behavior. That is akin to saying black Americans should have thicker skin. You can be an excellent driver yet have an accident one day.  Do we look at how you drove well for 40 years, or do we focus on the one day where you hurt or killed someone? While she had a cute excuse for her racist behavior, a law school professor knows and understands racism and our racist past and yet ignored that knowledge to be cute. Subtle racism is still racism. Do you understand the history of black face and how conservatives lampooned black Americans with it? Ever notice any black Americans dressed in white face for Halloween?"
Nice how commenters are dismissing this out of hand because they all are black and well acquainted with the reported experiences.
"""Pinpointing black people""?  In the hometown of Obama?  Sorry, McCoy wrong town to try to claim prejudice based on race.  One thing Hawaii people learned a long time ago, criminals come in all colors, races, creeds and ethnicities.  Smith better pray that he has facts and evidence he can present at trial, or he is going to be gone for 40 years courtesy of the Hawaii taxpayers.  If he gets to go to Halawa, he better hope the folks he shot don't have any friends or relatives there.  Otherwise, his time served will end quickly when he meets with an ""accident"".  Ain't too many brothers there to protect him in OCCC or Halawa."
"Censured for its apartheid, Pretoria boasted of greater human rights and better living conditions for blacks under white rule, complained about being singled out for opprobrium, labelled resistance terrorism and gave blacks truncated enclaves ruled by powerless chieftains. Sound familiar?

The South Africa analogy is admittedly unfair. Not even during apartheid's darkest days were blacks prevented from using certain roads (as West Bank Palestinians are) or had Apache gunships unleashed on them."
She needs to educate herself on Africa to understand black culture. The atrocities and the inability of Africa to take care of its people says a lot.
Whites will always be the defenders of all atrocities their ancestors executed and refer to an unwritten history of blacks massacring Koi people. This is a pure lie in defense of what their ancestors did to blacks. What Germans did they accepted their brutality against Jews and today they are better friends. White South Africans are stubbornly  refusing to apologize for the atrocities they performed against blacks across the African continent. By so doing harmony amongst the races of SA remains invisible.
"Racist hates groups like Black Lives Matter killed 5 police officers and tortured a young disabled boy. They did this, because the mainstream media told them they were been killed by white people. Statistics show that such an assertion is fake news. Even white cops shoot far more white people than blacks. But fake news is mainstream now. Demagoguery is just as bad within the media, as it is with any politician."
"At the same time, here in our oh-so liberal Canada, the guy, who unexpectedly attacked and slashed innocent bystanders at Union Station with a machete, will most likely spend not a single day in prison (getting expensive psychiatric care instead), because 'he heard voices'. Just as Vincent Li 'heard voices' when he decapitated a sleeping (innocent) passenger on a bus and now, after the event faded, he is 'cured'.
The first perp is black; the other oriental.

"I am tired of those two groups pushing their agendas. Pride - Gays and Lesbians have achieved much by being on centre stage for such a long time. It is time for some other worthy cause to be given attention. Canadian blacks have imported the anti-police mentality from the USA. Yes, we all must work to ensure there is no discrimination, as we also recognize the need for blacks to clean up their communities which are often high crime areas - in this we support them. But, baring police from showing support for any group is unacceptable and NO PUBLIC FUNDS should be spent on supporting the parade."

"Penny calls blacks monkeys the ANC, ANCYL, EFF, DA, COSATU and HRC all line up to lay charges against her, thousands of blacks threaten her life.
Guptas call blacks monkeys and ..................................... 
What more proof does one need to see that these parties are not only racist themselves and anti-white but that they are ALL GUPTA OWNED. The DA has already admitted the guptas contributed to their election campaign and I bet if we looked closer at the EFF's books we would see gupta payout there too."
"According to today's (radical) feminist theory, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is outrageous.

Tom Robinson would have be guilty - not because he of racism and he was black - but sexism in that he's the man and the woman must be believed.

Why?  Women are always truthful when they cry rape - no women ever lies or has other motives or is ""mistaken in her mind.""  That's a reductive and highly chauvinist view if you think about it - the girl is always the damsel-in-distress pursued by a Dastardly Whiplash.

To be clear, it's terrible that actual rapes go unpunished.  But sadly, such is the he said-she said nature of much of these crimes.  Better ten guilty go free than punish one innocent person, as the proverb goes.  And better not put your thumb on the scale of justice to excuse relevant texts and tweets from the complainant."
"Not intended as a strawman, merely an analogy:
.
Man robs a banks. Uses the money to educate his kids. He gets caught. The money is recovered. The kids now suffer because they didn't get an education financed by dad's criminal behavior.
Woman crosses the border into the U.S. She wants her kids to have a better life. She gets caught. However, this time the kids won't suffer from her illegal behavior because some citizens want to ""give her a pass"" on her crime.
.
I don't define myself as racist because my godfather is a first-generation Mexican immigrant and one of my roommates is the son of legal Mexican immigrants and two of my cousins are half black. Regardless of that, I think that anyone who breaks the law should suffer the consequences. I understand that innocent children will also suffer, but they need to blame their mother and not the American immigration system."
Are the Toronto police also investigating the blatantly racist hate speeches given by black activists who called for open revolt and armed asset seizures of farm land from white farmers? Racial politics is hard to take seriously when the laws we already have on the books are not applied equally

"How many of those minority groups does Black Lives Matter vent against? Few if any. How many of those South Asians or Chinese people are the ones confronting and shooting black people? Zero. It's also highly ignorant to assume that they are newcomers, because many are not.

You are correct!"
that`s all they are good at to preach that bible and versgle was toch their practices looking at how they marginalised blacks and advanced and entrenched afrikanerdom!revolution in terms of the struggle was to demise afrikanerdom;westminster and westernism but afrikanerdom reigns supreme;institutions of the public sector are westminster and western!
Sad irony is that Lai's skin color is about the same as many African Americans who have lighter black skin.  It is agreed Hawaiians have been dealt a bad deal over a hundred years ago but to propagate hate and anger from generation to generation does more harm than good.  It is not lack of money to improve the life of Hawaiians when KSBE & OHA together are worth BILLIONS yet their focus is making maximum profits building million dollar condos for outside investors.  How about use the money &  land they sit on & develop truly affordable housing for Hawaiians.  Not like the Homestead program where they wait decades before getting housing.  Hoopili will nothing more than a urban sprawl but what if they had used that land to build mini farms/homes at a loss to the KSBE/OHA or whoever and made it a Hawaiian community that give them a place and identity.  Also education is key & continue to teach them Hawaiian culture but Western education as well.  Teaching hate has serious consequences..

"A mob of far-left Black bloc and Antifa people protested against people in Quebec, City who wanted to protest about Canada's immigration system and against migrants who are entering Canada illegally.

The far-left Black bloc and Antifa protesters stopped the freedom of assembly, the freedom of speech, the freedom of expression of the people they opposed.

The far-left Black bloc and Antifa protesters were violent and clashed with police.

The far-left Black bloc and Antifa protesters were violent and harassed and assaulted Global News staff interfering with their freedom of the press.

PM Trudeau condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis and called the people, who were protesting about Canada's immigration system and against migrants who are entering Canada illegally, intolerant racists.

So, are the Black bloc and Antifa protesters the people PM Trudeau and his Liberals support?

Who will PM Trudeau say were violent in Quebec, City?"
Ask yourself if the blacks and Hispanics are any better off for giving their votes to Democrats year after year?  Don't believe the polls for one second either.  You had best prepare to call in sick on November 9th since you will be too drunk to drive with all of your sorrow over President Trump's massive victory!
Interesting how liberals side with blacks on this issue but side with the cops if the victim is white like Lavoy Finicum
The trans movement is driven by man-hating feminists who want to save boys by convincing them that they're really girls. We're so horrified by female genital mutilation in foreign lands but in the west we're enacting constitutional protections for castrating boys on a political whim. I feel like I'm a black man trapped in a white mans body so where's my government funded racial reassignment surgery?
"So you mean that when unarmed blacks shot in the back by cops for just being black in the wrong place that is acceptable to you?  What I think about those who turn this argument around to "" see that it is the blacks fault they get killed for no reason"" since hundreds of blacks are killing each other anyway, pure racism. Get off your high horse, police brutality has been around forever.  Why do black people tell their children not to go to the cops for help? Do white people do the same thing with their children? Many cops have a hair trigger, shoot first and ask questions later is never acceptable."
"It nothing to do with being black.

"" According to the ACLU’s original analysis, marijuana arrests now account for over half of all drug arrests in the United States. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simply having marijuana. Nationwide, the arrest data revealed one consistent trend: significant racial bias. Despite roughly equal usage rates, Blacks are 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana.""

"Roy, you are wrong once again.  Trump has threatened military action against ISIS, but NEVER made any threats against any foreign nation.  If you (mistakenly and/or disingenuously) would argue otherwise, please provide the quotes.

You really seem to have a problem putting words into President-elect Trump's mouth, don't you?  But I guess we have to give you a pass on that, as it was only the same tactic used by the entire corporate media throughout the campaign --- ""racist"", ""homophobic"", ""hates women"", ""hates Hispanics"", ""hates blacks"", etc. etc. etc.  The man is many things --- narcissistic, crude, lewd,  and vulgar --- but I do not see where he has ever made any direct statements such as you incessantly and dishonestly ascribe to him."

But in your world those disgusting actions should be considered noble."

A lot of people come to alaska to run from something else, some are born here.  But the truth is whether implants or homegrown we have plenty of scummy people from all cultures in this town. 

Whites take the cake in pedo computer crimes, blacks have shooting/violence, natives have rape, islanders have assaults, asians like to dabble in every thing including gangs. Ty Korean mafia.  

So stop acting like this is a 1 culture issue.  It's a garbage people issue.  Too many trashy people live here and breed."
". What did the liberals call Clarence Thomas and Ben Carson? UNCLE TOM...to then lecture how we must end racism in America. Today, pushing the race card translates to bank cashing in, whether personally or politically. It has also masterfully deflected from the dysfunction of the black community.

There are always going to be a % of bigots in any race just as there will always be a % of that race born mentally handicapped.

"""Is it comparable to assuming Ralph Northam supports killing mostly Black kids in the womb?""

"It's not BLM's party! A group of radical professional activists who called Trudeau a terrorist. They have no credibility and act like spoiled children who stomp their feet and plug their ears when they don't get candy. Pride has capitulated to threats of direct action and in doing so have severely damaged their reputation as an inclusive organization. BLM have hijacked Pride for their own self-serving agenda. Also, it's not like there aren't black police officers in Toronto... you're embarrassing yourself, BLM's antics should not be rewarded. The event should be changed to the Pride by BLM - as it's clear they dictate who can and cannot attend and Pride goes along to get along."

"It was not the Democratic Party that started the KKK imbecile. It was started by a bunch of racist who happen to be Democrats, but they didn't represent the Democratic Party. It's like saying because  few white people are racist then all white people are racist. We know that's not a fact, so there is no correlation in being a Democrat and starting the KKK. Here is quote from politifact: ""Historians generally agree it was founded by a handful of Confederate veterans in Pulaski, Tenn. as a social fraternity and it quickly changed into a violent group that terrorized newly empowered black and white Republicans in the South."" It's obvious that you have a learning disability. Get some help please. You are just like your idol Trump just throwing things against wall to see if will stick. By the way...what about Andrew Jackson...did I make a fake fact that he owned slaves? Just so you know, Andrew Jackson started the Democratic Party."

If you believe in an individual right, then have the courage to show us all the evidence thereof.  Also explain to us why black slaves never were afforded your mythical right."
"Black Lives Matter is definitely not a group concerned with dignity.  One only has to look at their ""rallies"" that involve shouting down those who disagree, and rioting, and destruction of property (usually affecting predominantly black neighborhoods).  Church leaders need to call an evil organization what it really is."
"Exactly. If not guided properly, blacks destroy everything they touch. Just look at the third-world dump South Africa has turned into post-apartheid. Then look at the rest of Afreak post-colonia."
"You don't give a hoot about the people killed in those neighborhoods, don't try to distract the argument   Your  purpose is to present Black as genetically/culturually predisposed to violence and you know it.    You ignore the innocents in those neighborhoods, you ignore the grieving mothers, father, brothers, sister that mourn for the dead, the thousands that escape the poverty.

And yes, I have the same problem with white liberalism that ignores this pain and loss of community for our black citizens.    They wrongly think that the problem can be fixed with subsistence income and it requires MUCH more than money alone to move those suffering communities to health.

And since you have difficulty grasping the reality of being black in American, the damage done by racial bias is NOT all reflected in violence against blacks, it is not just a police problem, it does not always end in violence, it often leads to poverty, poor education, poor health services.

But you don't care do you?"
"In a prior comment you said you didn't ""agree"" that Trump was a racist. Now, in your last comment, you admit you knew all about his illegal anti-black housing discrimination. If refusing to rent to an American citizen for no other reason than the color of his or her skin isn't racism, what is it? Since you voted for the segregationist to the highest office in the land, I guess you'd call it presidential. And leadership. And admirable.

You admit that you know Trump broke the law in order to discriminate against black Americans, but you voted for him so he could appoint Supreme Court Justices. A guy who even you admits broke the law in the name of segregation is also the guy you want to appoint justices to the highest court in the land. Why is he qualified for that? So we can have another anti-black decision like Dred Scott or Plessy v Ferguson?

This is why POC hate the GOP. Because white Republicans freely admit illegal racism is a-ok with you."
"You've got to be kidding me.  what you're really saying is all blacks today are still suffering from their ancestors bad living conditions.  No, they are not, I'll bet they don't even have names. (too long ago to have known them)  Besides, it was US, the white  Americans that put an end to slavery.  WE got it right, now they have their rights.  Slavery still exists in Africa.   But not here in the land of the free.  Where EVERYONE has the  opportunity to get rich.  Even illegal immigrants. (and many do)  Stop blaming America for buying into African culture.  Slavery is wrong, we know it, and did something about it.  If you still hate slavery, GO BACK TO AFRICA AND FIGHT IT!"
"Sigh.  Human Rights Tribunals don't 'convict.'

If you don't like a decision of a Tribunal, you can apply for judicial review. 

If you refuse to pay the money they order you pay the complainant, you might have your wages garnisheed or your office furniture sold.  

If you refuse a direct non-monetary order of any civil court or tribunal - after exhausting all avenues of judicial review and appeal -  yes you might be found guilty of contempt, and, who knows, it might lead to jail.  It's called the rule of law and it applies to any of the thousands of different types of tribunals and civil courts in Canada.

If there is a trial for contempt, it will be in a court, and will use the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

I happens rarely in Canada.  The only one I know is a Terry Tremaine, who had been posting the most disgusting hate against  ""persons of the Jewish faith, blacks and other non-white minorities"" and continued posting it."
Lewis is a POLITICIAN and if Lewis enters the political arena he deserves everything he gets by Trump. What does the MLK holiday and his arrest 50 years have to do with what the old dinosaur says now?

"Sherrilyn Ifill Makes some assumptions that I believe are completely false. First, she states that the officer in the helicopter's statement that ""That guy looks like a bad dude"" is racial. Where in that statement is there anything having to do with race? What would she say if the officer made the statement about a big white guy, not complying with police orders? And it turned out the officer in the helicopter was black? Would it then also be a racial remark?

She then goes into a description of the events in Charlotte, ""Scott exited the car, carrying a gun. While it remains unclear how events unfolded, even if this an accurate description, North Carolina is an open carry state. But Scott was black"". In that situation, whether open carry is legal or not, anyone, white or black that steps out of a car with a gun in their hand is violating the law. It is called brandishing a firearm and is not legal in any state in this country. Failing to obey orders got him shot, not being black. Fact."
"Hey, he could be declared unfit before the election.  Every day he gets  wilder.  I don't see your list as being enough if he does make it.

"Odd.  Sanctions were o.k. against South Africa (because they discriminated against black people).  They're o.k. against Russia (because they grabbed Crimea).  They're o.k. against Iran (because they might--or might not--be building nuclear capability).  They're o.k. against North Korea (because they're just plain nuts).  If you're the US, they're o.k. against Cuba (because they have a different political system and refused to bow down in obeisance to their American Masters).  So if they're applied against Israel, why are they automatically rejected as ""anti-semitic"" (which is itself an inaccurate designation, as many Arabic people are also semites)?   Sanctions and other more severe measures are warranted against aggression and apartheid, whether based on race, religion, or any other slice-and-dice, and irrespective of whether or not the aggressors were, in the past, victims of others' aggression.  Israel must be measured by the same rules applied to everyone else."
"Yeah right! Sexist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-black attitudes in the military have been prevalent for decades, often encouraged and promoted by the upper rank officers.  It's always ""we'll take care of it"" excuse AFTER one scandal or another happens but it always is swept under the rug (well, they can afford a gigantic rug with the budget they have). Let's face it, the job of the military is to groom killing machines, and that means getting the best bunch of goons together with a singular purpose of destroying things and killing other human beings. Don't think sensitivity training is in the training manual."
"Your suggestion that Mr. Dalton is a member of the Black Riders is disingenuous Bill Hooper 651 as nothing in his posts indicates that he supports anything radical but if he did there'd be nothing wrong with that. I support the aims of the Black Riders. I'm a radical. Radicalism has a long history in the United States, and without it, American democracy would be weaker. William Lloyd Garrison, the famous abolitionist was an American radical as was Mary Wollstonecraft. Both were patriotic Americans who improved the lives of Americans and made the United States the great country--contrary to what Trump supporters claim-- that it is. Your ignorance doesn't scare me. I doubt it scares anyone."
"Apparently none of them realize that thousands of Latinos, Blacks, Asians, LGBT's, and other minorities, including more tha 50% of the women voted for Trump. Poor little snowflakes, luckily it's cold outside or they would melt. But hey spring will be here soon enough."

"Does that cover pictures as well? That would be the solutions to what I am asking to protect EVERYONE and not just gays. No words or images are required.

"I wish there were honest media sources not driven by ideology.

What happened in Portland is definitely terrible and I don't believe that every crime by refugees or muslims needs to be published by all local papers. Sexual assault by three refugees against a 5 year old stands out but it feeds  the side of the immigration debate not supported by the DP.

The DP ignores most of the approximately 280 murders every week, but they put this one on the top page. The DP controls the narrative by highlighting certain stories and ignoring others. 

I used these two stories as examples, but their are many others. Do you recall the baby in Georgia shot in the face by two young, black men? If you only read the DP you didn't hear that story. That was horrific but the DP and others won't cover those stories because it doesn't fit their chosen narrative. Conservative sites are as bad, only differing on their preferred narrative. They highlight crime by immigrants and minorities, equally dishonest."

""In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. “They are not just gangs of kids anymore,” she said. “They are often the kinds of kids that are called ‘super-predators.’ No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.”"
"So, I guess the future of hockey is for its athletes to become the physically gifted but arrogant, spoiled children that dominate basketball, football and baseball.

So far removed from everyday life and people, athletes in those sports, mostly black, move in  a world where normal rules and decorum do not exist. Scowling ""gangsta"" athletes, with their entourages, vapor trails of abandoned kids and wives, and quickly diminishing bank accounts in their post playing days.

Yes, that may well be the future of hockey. No more ""aw shucks"" humility, fake or not.

I'll pass."
"The Obama administration exposed the GOP as merely a white identity party, in the 21st century. They dedicated themselves to making him a failed president for 8 years. Never mind he was trying to save their poor relations. They refused any and all compromises offered to them. They made no counter offer other  than let poor and sick people suffer and die. They were willing to let their drug addicted relatives die rather than work to improve the ACA. A pattern has emerged with the GOP in general and Trump in particular.  They accuse others of the crimes they commit. Rigged elections and death panels come to mind. They have no problem abusing and or killing people for any number of reasons, including profit and revenge. Remember Flint? Flint children were poisoned just to save a buck. Flint voters tended to vote for Democrats so their lives don't matter to the GOP. The fact that a lot of poor black people live there sealed their fate. Michigan is run by white Republicans."
"Fascism is the politics of identity. We hear about fascism like ""Aryan race"" or ""white Power"". However,  ""black power"" ""feminism "" and other socially exclusive movements are identity politics  which may appear  kinder and gentler  but still have that  lingering fascist trait of  think they are better than everybody else."
There are a lot  of Trump voters whining about their lives. They need to take responsibility for their choices in life instead of blaming others for their failures. I admit their white skin is worth less in the 21st century. They can't even get away with murdering black people while they pray in church any more. That was so 20th century. They need to learn to get by on merit.
""" McCain is one of few Republicans willing to stand up for the American story.""  Unfortunate that Brooks couldn't resist partisanship.  It is that very partisanship that provides the foundation of our currently dysfunctional political environment.  McCain is an American first, a republican second.  Whereas Brooks is apparently the opposite, i.e. a democrat first and an American second.  It is hard to imagine how the modern liberal came into being.  The liberals who view Americans first as members of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender groups rather than as simply Americans.  The modern fake liberal is death to universality and solidarity.  Some day they will have all of us fighting between our little perceived groups, white supremacists, white males, feminists, blacks, illegal aliens, gays, and the list goes on.  Identity with the little group rather than as Americans."
"Great description of the Democratic Party of today. Particularly their expertise at fraudulent elections entwined in corruption and cronyism. How else did they do such a dismal job in the Ghettos, retain power while the Blacks murder each other, have little education or job opportunity.  Hillary, scapegoating election loss to Russia which I think is pretty well debunked. Probaby their own IT guys. Oh yeah  the Clinton man on the inside Comey. Even the media????

A charge he could easily have avoided if he had not chosen to disrespect the flag.   He also, like BLM, chose to put it into racial terms, when it did not need to be.   Nobody of any color should be shot unarmed by the police for no reason.   Or are you and Kaep racist enough to think that only black lives matter."

"Trump is a racist sympathizer.
He single-handedly used his wealth and fame to perpetuate the lie – wholly racist in nature – that President Obama was not born in the United States.
He has declared his intention to deport millions of law-abiding Muslims, ban immigration of Muslims, and has called Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists.
He openly accepted the support of avowed white supremacists during his campaign and has done virtually nothing to distance himself from these groups and their political aims since.
The neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups that marched in Charlottesville are similarly transparent in their purpose.
They believe in the supremacy of white European Christians over, well, everyone else.
In particular, they want to eliminate Jews and Blacks, and Latinos, Muslims, LGBTQ folks, feminists (perhaps women, generally), Catholics, and many others.
There is no mystery here."

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest. I'll save my sympathy on those who deserve it."
"one word: Xenophobia, and the entire article is trash at ground level - basic black racism is what negates the articles title entirely"
"""And police have continued to shoot and kill a disproportionately large number of black males, who account for nearly a quarter of the deaths, yet are only 6 percent of the nation’s population.""

I always find it interesting when media outlets compare the number of black males shot against their percentage of representation in the general population as opposed to comparing it to the percentage of blacks who are criminals.  Hmmm..I wonder if that's because there wouldn't be any gap at all, if they did.  Nawwww...there's no way today's media outlets would cherry pick the stats at hand to make a point....nawwwww...."
"Something hilariously hypocritical is going on, which basically unmasks the fact that this is not about patriotism, but about racism - through the conflation of partriotism and opposition to protests over racial injustice.

So, players have kneeled, players have remained in the lockeroom.  Owners have shown up on the field to lock arms with their players.

And while this is going on, WHILE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PERFORMED, the yahoos in the stands are yelling at the players to stand up.  WHILE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS BEING PERFORMED.

- Not standing deferentially.

- Not standing and paying attention to the glory of the flag and anthem.

-Yelling orders at black men below them.

. . . maybe they think that conduct IS what patriotism is all about??"
"The underlying issue is based on a lie; that African Americans are being unfairly targeted by police and that police are out of control. In fact, according to crime stats outlined in "" The War on Cops"" by Heather MacDonald, unarmed white men are more likely to be shot and killed in their encounters with Police than unarmed black men.  Additionally, it is widely known that crime rates are out of control in the black community, with close to 50% of America's murders taking place entirely within that one community, despite it forming only 12% of the population. Thousands of Black men and even young teens and children have died at the hands of other Black men since some NFL players started to opt out of standing for the anthem. Only a dozen or so unarmed black men have died at the hands of police, many of them non white."
"As a black man, I want white folks that want to fly the Confederate flag to be allowed to fly that flag as they want. That flag helps me profile white folks to avoid. That includes entire states like Mississippi. It is particularly useful after sunset. Without the rebel flags, white people might look innocent. Life is dangerous enough for black folks in this country. Making white bigots and racists to hide just makes America more dangerous for the rest of us. When I'm looking for a gas station at 2 A.M., it is good to see the rebel flag at the gas station. That allows me to drive past it, and save my life one more night."
"This racism perpetuated by The Gupta family, is similar to the one perpetuated by the Indian community in KZN, particularly Durban. The manner in which they treat black people, their disgust for black people, you would swear they too aren't black. I hope that this racist behaviour by the Guptas and you  calling them out Ranjeni Munusamy, hits home to the Indian community in South Africa as a whole. A beautiful article nonetheless. It's about time we get these bastards pay back their ill gotten money they are stealing with JZ and deport them back to India. As for the other people involved in state capture, they should get ready to trade their expensive tailor made suits and dresses for the notorious orange jumpsuit."
"I'm Asian, and about 70% of the racial slurs thrown at me have been from black folks. They ranged from ""Open your eyes!"" to ""Do you speak English?""
Should I accuse the majority of black people as racists or view them in a negative light?"
And the poll showing that 70% of blacks think there is black racism against whites....
"Exactly, Bell, but than again the woman and her boyfriend live in Texas.  Texas is supposed to be an open  carry state, but apparently not for brown or black skin people.  There in lies the problem."
"Considering blacks commit the most homicides by far, how is it ""as usual"" that a white guy shoots people?

"Her policies result in ""white flight"" from mixed-race school districts,  leaving predominantly black, Hispanic and other minorities in the school left behind, with less funding. In other words, more segregated. They take the white students, and the money (head-count funding) with them.
She has a right to her ""different ideas"" about education policy. But it is not ""silly"" to to expose her policies for what they really are. It is helpful to people trying to understand the issue.

"None of it matters.  Like I said from the beginning, Hillery Dillery will get in no matter what due to the mass corruption going on in this poor excuse of a country.   We are in an age where people of color can vote 5 or more times, brag about it on national television, and get away with it.  The dead arise again just to vote.  Identification can not be asked for.  Illegals get to vote.  Racist black groups are allowed to intimidate and even threaten voters at polling locations.  

America, the quickest to rise........the quickest to fall......."
It matters because this could and should be investigated as a hate crime. If it was white on black that would be the headline. Civil rights apply to all colors and this victim was assaulted because he was white
The irony – white Brits yanking the wires to make black nationalists dance.
Its also telling that even though I didn't mention blacks once in my comment you immediately assumed I was talking about the black community in relation to police violence.
"Again, I wonder if we are speaking the same language.  Please recall that in this country, a war was fought and laws were passed so that African Americans are able to enjoy the same rights and opportunities that white people have.  To this day, many white people, rich or poor, object to that notion.  Those people are white nationalists and; and, therefore, can safely be called fascists."
"domestikgoddez,  Evidently you do not read all the posts in this thread  here as I stated in a post below, I will post it again for you. "" I want to be very clear on this matter. .................. I have numerous BLACK friends who TOTALLY DISAGREE with what Linda Hamilton is pursuing in her career as a PROFESSIONAL PLAINTIFF.

""My BLACK friends are TOTALLY EMBARRASSED, DISCUSS-TED, by her behavior and actions.........""

I do not hate black people, but I really DISLIKE the BAD APPLE BLACK people as well as the BAD APPLE WHITEFACE people.   

If anyone is RACIST here it is Linda Hamilton, as she is CLEARLY using her SKIN  COLOR for NEGATIVE  purposes.  Look at her history.

"""You can't change what you don't discuss. We are discussing. That's a good thing.""

Really?  Funny, seems whenever a black or brown person points out ongoing white supremacist political, economic, legal, social or educational policies and practices in these United States,, they get shouted down by white Americans crying ""RACIST!"" and simultaneously accuse those who dare mention institutionalized injustice as 'playing the race card' (while, ironically, doing so themselves).  And white women are usually screeching it the loudest."
"I've met Linda Hamilton on more than one occasion and I can tell you from my own experience that she is a flat out racist and plays the part of a victim at damn near any and every chance she gets. She'll go out of her way to make sure it's pointed out that she's black and she scts like that gives her specal rights and privileges. The irony is that if anyone else points that same thing out to her in the exact same way she does, they're racist and trying to bring her down. If you want to be treated as equal, you must first see yourself as equal...a concept she still hasn't learned. It's too bad too, because she can actually be a pretty nice person if she wanted. Unfortunately she seems to only want to be a victim...and will probably try and sue the Register-Guard for allowing me to post this..."
"Black supremacy is OK though, eh?"
It all started because blacks want the 'right' to not be arrested following their robbing a 7-11. Need to keep this basic point in mind...
To the LVPD he was guilty of running while black.
"You say it’s racist to see black men as being more dangerous that white men.  FBI stats for 2014 show that about 42% of homicides are committed by black males, while by generous over-estimate, blacks constitute 20% of the population. (The more frequently cited percent of black population is 13%, but using that figure would increase the percentage of homicides by black males, so let’s err on the side of caution and use 20%.)  Do you think this statistic --- 20% of the population committing 42% of the homicides --- supports you?"
"Here we go...""I'm black so I'm the victim."" BLM brings their East Coast rhetoric to Hawaii. GTFOH!"
"Agreed, the black clad black shirted Fascists are far more intelligent, wearing hoodies and masks to cover their faces as they run riot , burn, damage public and private property, throw rocks etc., at policemen.

The brown shirts are National socialists ( Nazis) a different breed of totalitarian Marxists....the Reds, of course , are their socialist totalitarian cousins, the Communists.

Brown = National Socialists.

"When white supremacists murdered a peaceful protestor, Trump called them “fine people.” When Black Americans take a knee to exercise their First Amendment rights to protest racism and police brutality, Trump calls them “sons-of-bitches.” Everyday Trump brings shame to the office of President."
Another shooting in Baltimore. 8 people wounded by 3 gunmen. Police say it was a retaliatory attack from a Labor Day shooting. Add 11 more black on black shooting's. Where is black lives matter? Oh yeah there is no media value without a cop involved.
So the Repuglican majority in Congress is Obama's fault? That takes the cake. Apparently. everything is Obama's fault. Repugs are just helpless victims of the black president.
Milo only dates black guys.
I'm sure the millions of people suffering in the Middle East don't care that Obama is classy. I'm sure the families of policemen shot by inflamed blacks in the US don't care that Obama is classy.  Wow.

"Thats not what I suggested at all and im not really sure where any of what you said came from.  Again, the issue is that Trumps stance encapsulates ALL trans people.  If someone is just post-op and is still going through a lot of medical issues - I can totally understand why they should not be accepted at that time...just as I would expect an otherwise healthy individual who just broke their leg to not be accepted until they are back to being 100% again.   

But to deny a trans person who has been post-op for years and is no longer needing medical procedures done or anything like that - thats just wrong.  If they are physically capable of meeting the minimum standards for joining the military, then they should be allowed to join.  Trumps policy statement suggests that he does not care what the health is of the trans person is in any way; just that the simple fact they are trans, is a disqualifier.  Kind of like how being black, or a woman, or gay used to be."
"Whether or not these sour grapes Democrats decide to attend  the inaugaration or not is really insignificant. Maybe they could march with all the man hating feminists as well.   I expect that Congresspersons John Lewis and Maxine Waters will  keep up their race hustling along with the rest of the Black Caucus keeping Black people fearful, angry, resentful, and hating Whitey to keep them on the Democrat voting block to put these parasites in office to live high on the hog off the government.  On January 20th, 2017 Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.  Their beloved President Obama isn't going away though. He will resume his community organizing domestically as a race hustler keeping Black people on the Democrat voting block as a dependency class.  And he will go on the speaking circuit internationally getting very rich badmouthing his own country and advocating one world government under the United Nations in order to save the planet from GLO-BULL warming"
"How uninformed can you be?  Know one knows the whole stories yet in Minnesota and Baton Rouge.  What we do know is both black men had guns and in Baton Rouge he was resisting arrest.  By the way the officer involved in Minnesota was not white.

Good reasons to kill innocent people in Dallas. 

This is the problem, BLM and the like going nuts on partial and often incorrect information and always blindly siding with blacks."
"And the first flag the KKK used to hang poor innocent blacks was the Stars and Stripes. The flag used to commit murder, steal land, break treaties and commit genocide against Native American men, women and children was the Stars and Stripes. The yankee officers that after the war committed these horrendous acts were Sherman, Sheridan (the only good Indian is a dead Indian), Custer, Crook and others. The president of the United States that gave his blessings and orders for these atrocities was guess who......Ulysses Simpson Grant, the drunkard!"
"I find this rather ironic, especially since there are members of the gay community who find  rappers, predominantly black, to be quite angry, homophobic and disrespectful to the gay community... not to mention the Caribbean and African nations (again, predominantly black) that openly promote violence and even killing of gay men.

I'm still waiting for BLM to issue a response on  this topic (which they curiously seem to gloss over).  The irony of the situation is disgusting!"

"These lazy crybaby-boyz are pathetic!  Instead of kneeling why don't they stand up like men and work to CHANGE whatever they're 'protesting'.  

Hey big guys, put your money where your knees are, and for instance, set up school scholarships for disadvantaged youth, or go out to work with the misguided kids hangin' on the street corner, just wasting away their lives.

There's a thousand ways these big babies of the gridiron could 'make a difference' in the REAL lives of blacks----BUT that would mean manning-up and giving up some of their 'club time'. . . the paaaaaaaty scene livin' the high life of  a big shot.

Instead, the boyz prefer to 'take the knee' every week while the rest of the country stands to honor and revere country, flag and sacrifice.  

These louts are exactly where the left wants 'em----on their knees, genuflecting to the liberal doctrine of  their stinkin' politics.

Keep it up, and a lot more of 'em will end up like Kappernick, unemployed & hangin' on the corner."
"""But we are probably more tolerant than any Western nation""

That's ridiculous. You have twice the rate of hate crimes as the U.S. does. You are probably the only Western nation to be found to be denying the human rights of your own citizens. None of your minorities reach critical mass as far as pct of the population is concerned and as the writer of the article states, the majority in Canada is in firm control.  You're locking up your largest minority as a percentage of the population at a rate in excess of blacks in the U.S.
Your immigration policy would be unacceptable in probably every other Western country as it would be considered 'discriminatory'. Your 40000 recent immigrants were limited to families, homosexuals and orphans but they are bandied about as if your tolerance and inclusion is due to your genetics."
"America is a country and culture formed from a civil war contesting the issue of black slavery (there were no white slaves) and conflicts of powers between state and federal government. The other distinction is it relishes guns like no other civilized country in the world. 

Sadly racism has never left the psyche of America and continues to make the head lines despite a war that ended in 1865. 

They now have a fire breathing orange lizard that climbed from the gutter to light a fire and feed it with racism directed Mexicans, Latinos and Muslims. 

The country is not getting better but only worse. If America is serious about the race issue its time to impeach the orange lizard in the Whitehouse."
"right wing racial hatred has always divided this nation, it got worse during the '50s / '60s cos of the civil rights movements which improved relations somewhat among the educated but further inflamed the haters and it really pissed them off that they could no longer widely impose their toxic will or lynch with impunity. cue newt gingrich and his non-stop pounding of the wedge...
then ol' black Obama comes along after the disastrous dubya / cheny years and legitimately beats the crap out of the never right... TWICE! while heading a historic economic recovery and the hate mob's throbbing head veins couldn't take the pressure any more.
he irreparably divided this country merely by being black and then kicking righty butts for 8 years, they simply couldn't handle it and typically errant righty rants repeatedly prove it.
the only place to show O as the worst president in world history will be some little second hand trailer home found stuck in a ditch and used as a post-term trump library."
"The glaring and often repeated problem is that -- yes --- the only time you see marches in the street about Black lives mattering is when a police officer kills a black man.  The horrifying rate of black-on-black murder is ho-hum, even in the communities most affected by it."
"Unmm Hillary accepted 25 million from Saudi Arabia, that's about as ANTI women and ANTI LGBTQ as you can get.  In addition she eulogized Robert Byrd, high ranking KKK member.  The only thing she has done for the black community is push mass abortions, even for full term babies.  

Kudos to the Judge, these snow flakes don't know what they are talking about, maybe if the media covered hillary's pedo ring!"
"Good for you for speaking up, and you were certainly not an embarrassment. If blacks are present and willing to speak for themselves, good for them, and non-racist whites should back them up or even take the lead as needed. If blacks are not present, non-racist whites should speak up on their behalf. Non-racist whites are not trying to take away black voices, but are trying to alter the thinking of racist or often just obtusely ignorant whites. Certain blacks who take offense at this (and shame whites into repeating it) probably have a racism or ignorance problem of their own. We all have a stake in combating racism as we are all part of our society and responsible for its improvement. Racism at this stage is a problem rooted in individual behavior, not something to be applied as a blanket statement towards the entire white race because of things some white ancestors have done. If we are to be held responsible for our ancestors' actions, animosity between the races will never cease."
"Right.  Perhaps Texas A&M should have had better 'vetting'.  Might have stopped Charles J. Whitman.  Maybe if Milwaukee PD hadn't been so busy beating and executing folks for the crime of ""driving while black"" they would have caught Jeffry Dahmer with all those trash-bags full of ""long-pig takeout"" on the back seat of his car at 3:00 am.  If the Army more thoroughly ""vetted"" its recruits, maybe Robert Bales wouldn't have murdered 20 civilians in their beds.  Or if the CHP had properly ""vetted"" patrolman Craig Peyer he wouldn't have pulled over and groped Kara Knott, then bludgeoned and strangled her when she threatened to report him for it.  What cracks me up is that all these ""WE DON'T NEED GOVERNMENT TO TAKE CARE OF US!""-types seem to think that the way to stop crime (at least when committed by Muslims) is to demand government take care of us.  What's wrong with this picture?  Blatant hypocrisy, for starters..."
"I love the republican right wingers threatening churches with the loss of non-profit status and with heightened ICE enforcement tactics when they run afoul of their perception of what churches can legally do.  But what happened when churches wanted to carve out birth control provisions in Obamacare (a law which was passed by both houses and signed by the executive)?  Well back then these same churches were poor and oppressed, maligned and misused by the first black president.  It’s really the height of hypocracy."
"Joe Walsh is an insane maniac.   However, to be fair, I don't think that he represents the average Republican.  

He only served one two year term in the Congress.   Once people realized how crazy he was, they would not re-elect him.  He went into talk radio the next year, but was fired by his sponsor station just a year into working for them, for repeatedly using the word ""N I G G E R"" on his program.

He now has his own talk show, but it is just mainly online podcasts and YouTube videos.   It is only on the air on minor radio stations in only 4 cities in America.

He is now pretty much considered to be an abject failure, and a fringe person: a total loser.  Even his own wife divorced him, he is that bad."
"a definite possibility - if the guys in the car were loaded or especially stupid to do such things on W 11, chasing a black guy might have seemed a good idea.  I know that driving and walking ...living while black can be offenses for some people.  I jay walked with my black step brother across a street in Inglewood many years ago, more of a mixed race neighborhood - we got stopped by a cop who actually pulled over to the curb and  upshot was my step brother got a ticket!  I got a lecture about being a ""follower"".  blew my mind  - right then I learned ...yeah....different rules for different people."

Especially when the city we live in is 50% non-white.?"" She might also engage in some reflection on this city and province's history, where the franchise was originally limited to landed white men, where slavery existed, where black people were enslaved, and where the Family Compact reigned for many years, excluding not just non-white people from power, but non-Christians (and non-Protestants), as well. This country, this province and this city were founded on the idea of white supremacy. As BLM has said, ""the system isn't broken, it was built that way."" And, indeed, it was.

"I blame white folks for race based slavery and the white racism that still exists. They are the beneficiaries of that racial discrimination. Before white people, slaves were just the losers of the last war. European refugees learned to become white Americans by learning to fear and hate dark skinned people. If you are not happy with your life, you have no one to blame but yourself and who ever raised you. No one is profiling you.  No one is denying you a job because you are white. No one is keeping you from buying what ever you can afford. The police don't threaten to kill you over a busted tail light. No one is stopping and frisking you because you are white. Please don't commit a mass shooting of strangers in your resentment and rage. We know you have easy access to all the guns and ammo you want no matter how crazy you may be.

What a pitiful piece of racist editorial garbage! In a melting pot like America, some love separating the many diverse ingredients, and pitting them against one another, with their blatantly self-evident pieces of racist garbage, like this exemplar from the Washington Post.

Instead of trying to force blacks to like skinny jeans and whites to appreciate okra, how about we work instead on things like equal access to safety, comfort, education, opportunity, and justice? There'd be fewer angry blacks out there if they could get decent jobs and cops would leave them alone; and we whites would be more welcoming to them if blacks didn't feel the need to intimidate and blame the white folk around them. (These were only illustrative examples.)"
"So what has the Gasping Old Party learned since its 'autopsy' of 2012 (and 2008) - they continue to alienate women, Blacks, Latinos, Asians and other minorities, Millennials, LGBTs, non-saber rattlers, people who care for our planet.

No Republican can win the presidency with a constituency of old, angry, Bible thumping white folks. The votes simply are not there in today's tumble of real world diversity  - one they refuse to acknowledge and embrace. 

As for Lisa, she is increasingly speaking to Alaskans with a forked tongue while appeasing the GOP and her campaign contributors. Disappointing."
"WTF are you talking about? Obama started the KKK and other white supremacist groups? There is no ""alt-left"", either - the alt-right named ITSELF that, and it is strongly represented among white supremacist groups. These groups existed LONG before Obama, and the only thing Obama did to create this problem is have the temerity to be black and be President. Only someone blind to history would assert that racial violence started with Obama!"
"I am not stupid, or racist, nor homophobic. I believe in enforcing the laws long on the books concerning borders and immigration. I believe our president should follow the law and address Congress, not the UN, when deciding major issues that greatly affect our Country. I believe globalism is the death of America. I believe that the 2nd amendment is a God-given right. It's not about deer hunting, that is a stupid. And I believe that calling people who you do not understand nor agree with racists and other names are simply bully tactics the left has used successfully for years. But the folks who earn taxes to pay for the social and global programs that the left (and ""right"") shove down our throats are about done with that.

Anyway, I'd rather be thought of as stupid by people who love obama than be thought of as smart by them. My gay friends and black friends agree. And the gal at the Target wearing a hijab asked me to pray for her son, after noticing my cross. Or was that Taqiyya...?"
"You just called Israelis""Israelites"". That alone makes me question the knowledge and independence of this journalist.

People who are ignoring that the BlackMonday march was little more than a neo-BroederBond stand against the Democratic state, are ignoring the essence of Malema's speech. Simply put, be prepared to be treated the same way by the state as it treats Blacks."
"CNN’s editor-at-large, president of the Ivanka Trump Fanciers Club, and life-long beneficiary of the Mediocracy has concluded that the Supremacist-in-Chief’s attacks on African-American athletes are deliberate attempts to stir up racial animus. 

Trump knows this. 

He is an avid consumer of TV and culture.

He's also a racist.   And a traitor."
"All I can say to these 32 players is: If they have any family that were or are in the military, and furthermore if they fought in any U.S. wars. THEY WERE TRAITORS TO THE CAUSE. By you disrespecting the flag and this country you are saying your ancestors are traitors to your cause. So I hope none were decorated because you HAVE to just confirmed that they fought and gave their life for nothing! How stupid you really are. It just shows that you didn't receive a degree of excellence from your university but you got a scholarship and degree for FOOTBALL itself. The Constitution freed the blacks, it wrote amendments to provide equal rights for all. It's not the Country that has let you down but people that have harsh positions that can't be changed by laws. In fact most of the allegations of abuse toward blacks have happened in purely democratic elected precincts. Ones that have been democrat for 40 years. AND YOU KEEP VOTING THE SAME BIGOTS AND RACISTS YEAR AFTER YEAR INTO OFFICE."
"Because a black president has to be articulate, well mannered, not 'uppity' in any manner whatsoever, but a white male President can flaunt his ignorance 24/7 and get a free pass. That's why."
Then they should move to a majority black country where they won't have to rub shoulders with the white people they hate so much. They will stay because there is no white man to mooch off in the black countries.
"You should walk away, but pick the mic up as you have not proven your point.  Most employment is ""at-will"" meaning you can leave or be fired at any time.  Other than actors playing in a movie, only white Americans dress up as black Americans.  An outrageous reaction would be to put her in jail for her actions.  If this 50 year old professor wants to use poor judgment, why would that give her a cause of action to sue?  Is it wrongful termination to not want an ""alleged"" rapist teaching class?  Is it wrongful termination to have an ""alleged"" racist teaching class?  No one wants to associate with a rapist or a racist, allegedly or not.  If your actions outside of your employer have an effect on your ability to do your job, your employer has every right to fire you.  Just because not many black Americans live in this community doesn't make it okay to mock black Americans.  The only bigotry is coming from her and those that defend her actions as no big deal."
"Don't you mean ""rich BLACK sports stars""?

That's what you really mean right?

We should (lynch, whip) FIRE those SOBs!

Right?"
It may be the unforeseen consequence for hating our first black president.  Our us senate is the classic example of tribalism.  Societies headed by reckless male chieftains (read republicans) has shaped this country into classic racist tribes.  This mind set will fade as generations move on.   It seems white uneducated males have jumped aboard the heroin highway and simply forgot the dossage. Classic birth control.
You don't seem to understand the difference between street crime and government sponsored murder. We know the police are happy to kill every black criminal they can. They have no interest in hunting the murders in their ranks. That is the problem.
"""The Southern Poverty Law Center has called the Federation for American Immigration Reform a hate group since 2008...""

This is the same SPLC that claims that the largest category of ""hate group"" in the land is Black and/or Muslim. 

The company counted 201 Black and Black Muslim groups for 2016, which far outnumbers its 130 alleged Klan groups outright, and all of its alleged neo-Nazi, racist skinhead and white nationalist groups by two-to-one, respectively.

The SPLC also claims that its 101 anti-Muslim ""hate groups"" pose an existential threat, but nobody in the media seems to believe that the SPLC's 89 Muslim ""hate groups"" are even newsworthy. That's nearly a one-to-one ratio.

http://wp.me/pCLYZ-N9

If the SPLC are going to be your go-to ""experts"" then you have to accept ALL of their claims, no matter how inconvenient and patently ridiculous they are."
"Paul, I deal with facts, not theory. You tell me when the majority of white people wanted to integrate with black and brown people. Please give us a year and date for when that happened."
How many times do you have to say the the cop was white and the kid was black? What does it matter? Just trying to incite racism? Maybe if the black kids black parents had informed him to not carry a black bb gun he would be alive. Maybe if the black kids black parents had taught him to stop when the white police officer says stop he would be alive. The lack of parenting from the black parents has now made a good white police officer have to deal with  the knowledge he killed a poorly raised black kid due the black kids bad decision. Reap the rewards of not teaching what happens when you run from police and then pull a gun on them. Glad the white officer is ok.
so you're saying it's only political and against Trump and nothing to do with the way blacks are treated in America.
"I'm tired nursing the fragile egos of insecure white folks. I'll stop mentioning race the moment we have equal rights. For example, I get profiled for just being black. The police have never protected and served us as a priority."
"You have a point here. Trouble is just when the DA was becoming a credible opposition to the corrupt ANC , Zille had to make her silly tweets about Colonialism being ""not all bad"" and blacks ""having to be grateful to their white saviors"". Zille could have got much more political mileage by simply pointing to Zupta corruption.You can imagine how the Zille tweets felt to those of us who could not become  angineers or accountants under apartheid because this was not allowed. (My elder brother , retired pyschiatrist living in the UK wanted to study engineering but had to study medicine . ""Bantu could not study engineering in 1967) If you were not at the receiving end of apartheid ( I am 66 years old and know the worst), it is easy to say ""get over it"". Having said that , there is no doubt the ANC has to go. What is the alternative to corruption?The DA with people who think like Zille or the EFF which is not ready to govern ( in a corrupt way like the present ANC or otherwise )IMHO."
"""that it apologize for slavery""? ""anti-black racism ""lies at the core"" of many Canadian institutions"". What?! 

This is ridiculous. Get a sense of proportion. There are so many problems in the world, and the UN comes up with this?"
"Pot, meet Kettle. It is black."
"ok lets make it simple for you and your friends.
if it's the way blacks are treated in America the issue, why didn't they protest when Obama was president.
why all of a sudden Trump is the bogeyman and not the treatment of blacks."
"Not excusing this woman's behavior, but have you ever noticed that the lion's share of Hate Crime charges are leveled against Whites when Blacks are the victims?  But when the situation is reversed, Hate Crime charges are very, very rare against Blacks when the victims are White.  Why is that?  Whatever happened to ""equal protection under the law""?  Are some more ""equal"" than others?"
"""blacks only make up 15% of the population in the US but commit over 50% of the crime""? 
Where on earth did you get these numbers?"
"Your interactions with the white sector of the country have been hurtful and difficult. What concerns me  though is that the gist of your article is that racism exists from white to black and that is its definition.
From the rantings of the ANC and EFF leaders it is quite obvious that racism from blacks is evident against whites.
And of course there are other very large cultural  groups that you do not mention: the so-called ""coloured"" and the Indian population who arrived here as either slaves or indentured labour. And let's not forget the refugees from Somalia and elsewhere North who are derided by local Africans as “makwerekwere”.
So yes, we certainly do need to talk about racism in all its aspects and as Ms Thlabi says: 
""not all white people are racist but that does not mean that racism does not exist"" and my caveat to that is ""not all black South African people are racist  but that does not mean that racism does not exist in every sector of society"" 
And how will you change it?"
"You live in a black and white world, don't you? This isn't about athletes. It's about police shooting innocent black people."
"Why did employment have to increase under a White President and did not increase when an Afro-American was in the ""White"" House? Obviously, the employers and workers are racist. 

Adding to that is the reduction in illegal aliens [ahem, I mean undocumented immigrants], reducing the labor surplus due to Trump's racist insistence upon enforcing our borders. As we all know, our southern border is illegitimate, so people are entitled to come here to be criminals, parasites, terrorists -- and be forcibly subsidized by the US taxpayer. /sarc"
"Unlike JBS, which always opposed racism, Buckley was also an unapologetic defender of white supremacy. Since the 1950s, Buckley had argued that civil rights should be opposed not because black people were biologically inferior to white people, but because they were not yet “civilized” enough to take part in democratic government. Or, as Buckley put it in 1959, “There are no scientific grounds for assuming congenital Negro disabilities. The problem is not biological, but cultural and educational.”"
"BLM Activists Message: Sorry non-blacks you must give us whatever we want whenever we want.  If our leaders want to scam U of T ( See Sandy Hudson), that's just fine because BLM activists expect the finer things in life (and feel entitled to things to be paid by other people), but it's all the cops and non-black Canadians fault that our social justice warriors dropped out of school and didn't want to work.  It's because or racism that these activists are not all doctors, lawyers, tradespeople, etc, please never mention personal accountability.  So mayor tory and trudeau pony up more money, these iphones and expensive hairdos are not cheap and every non-black person should pay for these things to right manufactured  wrongs.

Seriously BLM should stop watching US news and equating police problems down south and trying to tie that to Canada..  Black supremacy is just as bad a white supremacy, and that's a fact.

BLM Toronto, just another social justice warrior extortion racket."
We get it. You don't think a black man should be able to be president.
"Racism is not the same as prejudice, bigotry or ignorance. Black people, for example, cannot be racist but they can be prejudiced. They can be prejudiced against white people for example. They cannot, however, be racist because racism describes various aspects of a system of disadvantage based on race. Black people cannot be racist because they do not benefit from such a system since such a system was designed specifically to deny them equality in American society. 
I am white, of European descent, but am somewhat prejudiced against white people because they are frequently racist and rarely genuinely acknowledge the the racist reality faced by non-whites in American society."
"You forgot the part where blacks are racist toward whites. Other than that I could not agree more. One thing you missed is that the dream you refer to pretty much excludes whites. Why else do you think that the new generation of white kids who did nothing wrong don't want to hear or talk about it. You can justify it any which way you want but it is just reverse racism. The laws governing this country has nothing to do with equality and everything to do with power and keeping control. The Africans didn't stand for it before so I find it ironic that the Africans expect minority groups to just except racial discrimination and be happy about it. Can you imagine if the same laws and quota systems were implemented in the US or the EU? Can you imagine if black players were replaced in the NBA or NFL with white players to ""reflect demographics""? Do you know what would be the first words out of their mouths? LOL but here in African... well, it's Africa. Dreams, promises and rhino horn."
"1. The electoral college system is plainly anti-democratic - its a system that permits election of the loser of the popular vote. That's the very definition of anti-democratic.

2. Google ""crosscheck."" Its a system set up by Republican operatives that matches last ad first names of registered voters in different states. The states then remove people from the voter rolls (in some cases without even  notifying them). So, ""John B. Washington"" in North Carolina gets removed because there is a ""John C. Washington"" in Indiana. The program disproportionately targets black people because of the commonality of some last names (i.e. inherited slave owner names).
Also, look at what, i.e., Wisconsin, Ohio, North Carolina, and various other red states have done regarding, i.e., number and distribution of polling places including number of machines at different polling places); availability of early voting, etc."
"Firstly I do not defend the old flag. There are not enough comment characters available for proper, clear debate. Secondly my problem with this article is the continued attack on anything Afrikaans by mostly libtard journalists and opinionistas. Thirdly my biggest gripe is with the apparent want by these writers to deny history and write certain segments of society who are part of this country and history from history. Fourthly their hypocrisy of pointing out the wrongs of the past but then suggesting same oppressive remedies is sickening. Such as the removal of ANY symbols of a group and their identity or attacking their language and culture CONSTANTLY. How is that any different from past attacks on the dignity and culture of black South Africans? Lastly your example of a Hitler statue in TelAviv is not the same. If you said in Berlin it would be more accurate. There are hardly any non-Jewish Germans living in Tel Aviv or Israel or having played a direct role in the history of Israel."
"You realize that the CP stands for ""Colored People"" and advocates solely for blacks. Yet the NAACP's openly racist policies are ennobling ""diversity and inclusion""?"
"Only French Catholics allowed, right sky? Better build a wall around that town to keep all the others out, right? No Muslims, no blacks, no Jews, no WASPs even. 

Good grief."
"Do you mean when will supporting the concept of lynching black folks stop being abhorrent?  Never, I hope."
"I am not as aware of David Duke's preferences as you are.

But I suspect he and all his white racists did vote.  

How about the black racists?  Why didn't they vote?  You are black; you should have more of an idea about that than even about David Duke."
"The main reason that the GOP is mostly white is due to the fact that minorities are listening to the wrong voices.  Blacks listen to Al Sharpton instead of Herman Cain and other blacks who have figured out that they can do better in a world run by conservative policies that make it easier for them to use their entrepreneurial spirit to get ahead than under liberal policies that keep them from using their entrepreneurial spirit due to burdensome regulations.  Once blacks an other minorities flee the Democratic plantation of welfare and hand-outs, they never look back."
"WOW, 64goo knows sooooo much about black history. He must be black right?"
You fail to report the reasons for the bad condition of black neighborhoods - and it is not the fault of the other races. The lack of supermarkets is caused by the customers there - no smart business wants to deal with them.
"I am flabbergasted. Black on black violence and racism? Is this true? But, but all the Canadian media and European socialist media for decades have been writing that only Caucasian people can be racist and anti foreigner. They've been stating that ""visible"" minorities can never be racist."
Notice how you don't exactly see African-Americans clamoring to support Affirmative Action to get more whites into the NBA. They complain only when it suits them. Why should blacks get affirmative action for colleges? They shouldn't. They need to earn it just like everyone else. They are definitely not discriminated against as much as the guilt trippers would have you believe.
"If a white person targets blacks or any other minority in a murder spree, condemnation from the mainstream media and the lib/left political crowd is swift and vocal. When white people are targeted for killing, the reaction of the professional hand-wringers and sob sisters is one of almost total silence compounded by obfuscation of the motive for the crime. Interesting."
"I hope they don't waste their time building black robots because they'll just refuse to work and end up shooting each other..
""The rioting in Milwaukee over a police killing of an armed black man has reanimated the issue of longstanding black joblessness.

"To me a Black Racist or a White Racist that uses violence are the same.   Please study the set up at the Charlotte park before you mouth off.  The violence and death of the young woman could have been avoided if authorities had done their jobs. The ""Unite the Right"" group, a mix of Neo Nazis, White Nationalists and heritage supporters were herded into a corner of the park surrounded three sides by police blockades. They had a legal permit. The unpermitted Antifa and Black Lives Matter also were herded into the same entry point where news media cameras and police were stationed. At first the police kept the much larger protestors group from clashing with the first.  Then the police told the ""Unite the Right"" and the media their permit was cancelled and they must exit at the original entry point or be arrested. The police evacuated the entry point but enforced the perimeter blockades funnelling the two  main groups together. BLM maced and beat escaping reporters and ""Unite"" people."
"The problem is that 6% of the population is responsible for 50% of the violent crime. White people get shot by cops too. I don't think we have a white privilege problem, we have a black crime problem. FBI stats are important."
"Time to leave and watch this Titanic sink...let them enjoy their party tonight...and then lets fill 'er up with vagrants and never do goods...

"Charles Blow is a CNN contributor, NYT columnist, and african american with a booming voice.  He is NOT kind in his assessment of 45.  He doesnt suffer fools wisely; particularly 45 supporters and their pretzel-ing attempts at justifying everything/whatever he does; generally plays by the rules, if there are any - will let 45 defenders talk without interrupting and will not allow them to interrupt/filibuster him, which seems to key strategy in their playbook on talking heads shows.   This of course makes him persona non grata among 45ers.  Personally, he reminds me a bit of James Baldwin.  Not sure about the birds of a feather remark, maybe start with they're both black? (LOL)"
"And per the Indian tribes who lost to the white European invaders, if we had more guns we could have won and driven them out. As usual racial drivel from a racist Alaskan. If the lower 48 tribes had won you would be touting the great victories driving the European back across the big water. There are bigots in every race to quote a well regarded black."
"Black lives matter protests Michael Brown being killed and the police show up ready for war, white supremacists protest and the cops just kind of shrug.  The police are making the point that the whole BLM movement was trying to make for them, that there are 2 very different systems in this country, one if you are white and one if you are black."
"Sure, obviously she should apologize: 
for attempting to educate and venerating the black community for their achievements and for expressing her intentions of respect and admiration to her guests & (overwhelmingly white) students.

And further atone for not fully allowing herself to be publicly lynched for what you do & wear within YOUR OWN HOME.  


Was I personally offended:  No !!!   If I was present and bothered to inquire what her Costume actually was, I would have been enlightened and the better for it.   

Perhaps next Halloween, she could dress up as a Corp Oil owned Police Officer with a bloody baton who beats, maces & shoots, unarmed American Natives and environmentalists, since even our own President and Top Political candidates are teaching us that DOING NOTHING to stop such human tragedy is POLITICALLY CORRECT.  

Having a conscience is one thing, 'pretending' to have one is quite another.

In return, I apologize to Nancy Shurtz, for this lash she had to unfairly endure."
"No - ALL ""voters"" in those cities would be impacted, not just ""liberals"". Those fat-cat Wall Street-ers in New York, many of whom are undeniably conservative Republicans, would be stuck. The problem with the Left is that they think in terms of everything being black-and-white, this-or-that. If you live in a ""red"" state that Trump barely won by a few thousand votes, by golly then EVERYBODY in that state must be a backwards-thinking Trump-loving hillbilly. That's how the Left thinks."
"Where else in Africa was there a decent education?  The short answer is - white privileged education in South Africa, with a spend per child 6x that of a black child."
"Did those who voted for Hillary ""fear"" preborn babies, heterosexuals, or white men? BTW, I assume some of you leftists are aware that black babies are aborted at a higher rate than whites?"
Just because they are black doesn't mean they are not prejudiced and hate other races. Blacks in America are no more pure of heart on racial issues than are white people.
"Also, there is no sense pretending you are willing to engage in a discussion. The only time you've offered any specifics is when you're trying to deflect to Hillary.

You haven't even attempted once to defend Trump or to even acknowledge his history of anti-black segregation and his teen ogling and his stiffing of small businesses.

Instead in almost every word of your comments, you dislocate your shoulder by patting yourself on the back for how civil you are. Watching you fawn over yourself isn't actually a discussion. It's especially hypocritical when you're applauding your own civility while you defend an uncivil Twitterpated anti-black segregationist.

Racism persists because of otherwise ""civil"" ""polite"" ""respectful"" people who reward and cosign  racists acts like Trump's anti-black segregation."
"Maybe because there are lots of competent black men and women who will help an organization. Look, Lange sounds like a nightmare that begs being fired. She us no different than a nasty, disruptive, white bigot. No organization should tolerate either. Don't, however, paint all people if. Plot eith the same broad brush. Lange is NOT representative of black people."
It's attitudes like the letter writer that are part of the problem (note... part). What's the big deal if a cop shoots a black criminal? I would hope that everyone would be concerned if the police gun down criminal suspects (or school cafeteria workers) before the courts have a chance to decide guilt and an appropriate punishment. Thomas seems to think that black criminals don't deserve that process.
"I believe, a bad choice based on ""black quilt"" or ""we're great because we choose a black women"" or both but certainly not merit. There were many inspirational women of greater merit who courageously fought long and hard for women rights. This woman, Viola, bought a movie ticket for the balcony seats not the more expensive floor seats. She then illegally (not as a black protest)  sat in the floor seat area, was caught, and arrested. She then had to be talked into going to court. She refused to take part in the existing black activist movement. Instead she moved to the USA. She's not an inspiration. Give me two 5 dollar bills please."
"Posting a picture of a black male charged with indiscriminate shooting of a gun during a fender bender accident might be 'profiling'?

Who knows?  

When I looked him up on line, every single mugshot with his first and last name was a black person, so I'm hardly surprised.


Only the jail could tell you why his picture wasn't posted.  I saw Jasmine Martina's picture on television last night, though, so it is a mystery.


There is also a 2013 Facebook entry for someone of that name in Springfield.  That black male appears to be displaying some sort of 'sign' with his right hand.  

They both fit the definition of 'punk', however, no matter what race they might be."
"You're taking one outlier case, and citing it to imply that most police are racist killers.   That just isn't true.

What is true is that police shoot more whites than blacks.  And that when police do shoot blacks, they are invariably breaking the law and resisting arrest.

It's also true that violent crime is far higher in black neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods.

And it's also true that BLM only focuses on the police trying to keep order, and not on the huge number of black on black crimes."
"The violence that happened in Charlottesville had little to nothing to do with racism. 

Y'all keep making this a ""white"" issue, when the fact of the matter is in this one short instance, it was ""whites"" committing violence against ""whites"", while in the grand scheme of things, blacks are killing blacks. Go figure."
"the main issue is homegrown  terrorist in the united states will now come out of the woodwork thank you Mr.Trump you really outdid yourself this time the White supremacist groups will use this tactic to there advantage like the KKK and Aryan nation and last but not least hell angels too.

America has enough Terrorist living inside their borders to really cause lots of damage  no need to the ban the people from the middle east and Africa the american people will wake up to attack from within their own borders and blame Muslim brother hoods and of course the American Black ganges too.  

Mr. Trump you have really gone and put your foot firmly in your Mouth sir shame Republicans will fill the heat now from all minority group from around the world not just Muslims or Somali groups and from India and Pakistan too."
"Play back all of the RNC video sessions, Gegonos, and see if you can actually count how many black faces you can find in any of the videos.  The attendance by blacks was so sparse that I had a good laugh."
"Fair enough, who wants to go to the beach or sit on the bus with a bunch of black crows."
"When Obama told the nation in the D.C. professor case that "" police acted stupidly "" before even knowing the facts----he told black America it was ok to hate police . When he told the nation last week that group Black Lives Matters was a justified group even though in their protests they chanted about wanting pigs in a blanket and wanting dead cops now---he told black America it's ok to attack police.  Obama sides based on color and  not the facts of each situation .  His very words are a wink to those blacks who use every event as a chance to steal and destroy others property .     And in other news : How many blacks slaughtered other blacks last night in Chicago ? It's clear Obama and Black Lives Matters don't care about lost black lives if the shooter is black."
""" The retired pediatric neurosurgeon ... is known for his personal high moral standards...""

Which are? 

I do know Trump recently attacked Republicans who weren't ""standing by"" their ""man"" when Trumps hateful sexual predatory comments came to light. 

Even a black South African immigrant to this country knows claims of criminal sexual acts when he hears them. Maybe we need to review our laws."

"Charles, do you really care about black lives? Serious question. You bring your extreme racist views on here but they really don't hold water. You held a good government job, you are very safe walking any street in Eugene. You cannot say the same for you, me or anyone else here walking the streets in the inner city black neighbor hoods. I know this for a fact. I have been attacked for being white, but blacks will be attacked by other blacks if they are in anthers ""turf"". My son was MURDERED by a black, a person who received ONLY 3 years in jail because he used the excuse he was black and should not face the consequences of his actions, it was whites fault for putting the hate in him. I still am not a racist Charles, I blame the person not the ethnicity. You get on here and spread your hate, a very narrow view without showing one bit of care about ""black lives. Read, learn, and show if you do really care about black lives."
"If the roles were reversed and a black man assaulted a white woman, the police would not have stopped looking for him until they at least arrested a black man. He wouldn't have to be the guilty one. It would be a surprise if he survived the arrest. When will the majority of white people admit the role of race in our society at large and in our criminal justice system in particular?"

"In other words, you don't want to explain why you aren't a racist.  But liberals have no problem calling me one when it fits.  people do falsely claim racism to stifle debate.  And I have no desire to shut you up, just to quit lying about me.  If you need to lie, then you have no argument to make.  Now, about using black people, that's all liberals do.  They have deceived themselves into thinking their policies help and that blacks care about statues. 
  I provide evidence from the mouths of blacks that reject liberal policies because it is real.  Not to score political points.  BTW, there are no political points to score on this forum."
"Because ""YOUR FOOTBALL"" is their lives and this affects them deeply.  Yes, they kneel for the unarmed black men [and children e.g., Tamir Rice] who have been killed by police and the police were not held accountable."
"More successful because western has had the power....but otherwise the same.
Jews now treat Palestinians as less than human.   Some black people in Africa were already engaged in slavery of their fellow black's before Europeans arrived.  FN peoples in Canada kept slaves.

"The Civil War ended in 1865, but generally in the South there has been no end of the ""us and them"" culture.  The hate comes with their babies milk.  It was once the blacks, then the Irish, then the Jews, then any one who looked twice at you.   For all its ""land of the free"" crap, the US is not a land of the free and never has been.  The Dreamers are just the next on line to get the treament."""
"Pull your head out Black.  Urban Alaska was at one time in the same circumstances as rural Alaska.  What makes you or urban Alaskan's so damn special that you deserve sanitation rights?  Rural Alaska is part of the state and shouldn't take infrastructure discrimination laying down.  State legislators should be ashamed of themselves for pouring billions of dollars into building access roads and bridges that we don't need.  It's long overdue to catch rural Alaska up with basic sanitation.  I don't know why the villagers don't come together, or use AFN to fight for basic sanitation once and for all. If you don't like it, MOVE."
"Why do you say universal health care is a disaster? Have you lived in the states? Paid the premiums for care which is available for the elites but having a doctor is not available to many many others.   Efficient patient care is necessary and changes are necessary but not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.  I WANT UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE!..  So did Obama, Hilary and Bernie... what Trump wants is simply to eliminate any good that Obama did BECAUSE HE IS BLACK!"
"Having worked all around the world, I would have to say Canada is at the lower end of places where racism is a factor. It exists but it is not a barrier to success or a factor that stops people from doing things. 

I have encountered far worse racism in China, India, the Middle East: it still holds that black people are viewed as being at the bottom of the race pile in most places in the world but will get the fairest shake in life in advanced Western states. 

Canada would be better off taking a more holistic view to racism and seeing it as part and parcel of many cultures, and to stop fixating on white European cultures and people. They are often the least racist you will encounter."
"The title of this column is ""Teaching Civility In The Time Of Trump"" which infers that it is he that is causing the rift.  And yet, all these hate groups existed before he came to office. 
The big division started with Hillary's divide and conquer campaign.
She spoke of white against black, rich against poor, man against woman, straight against gay. Now the media has continued to carry the same flag and stir it up in an attempt to blame Trump and so the Republican Party, and all that voted for President Trump.  Sad."
The heck with whether or not the  legislators support it!  What about the people paying for it?  Scrap the whole darn thing and save us billions.  Even if we had to pay uncle sam back and bust it down we would still be in the black.
"Far too many of those who voted for trump fell for the right media rewrite of NAFTA and other trade agreement that were in fact creations of the Republican free trade platform. The very same misinformed people who voted for trump turned around and voted to return the very same reps and senators to DC that had in fact been the root cause of their dis-infranchisement. Venture capitalists like Romney took advantage of trade agreements to ship entire factories overseas but I'll bet ya didn't see much of that on Fox didja? What really aroused the trumpets was not economic issues but the lies that trump told about how he would get rid of the threatening brown people, contain the blacks and outlaw the Muslims. Plus it's now okay to grope the neighbor girl because after all the POTUS does it too. This was whitelash mr. kon. Insecure white people voting for a loud mouthed birther, sexist, racist, xenophobic, sexual predator because he allowed them to express openly their own racist tendencies."
"DC,  As Motley points out, Lincoln was constrained by reality (politics).  Regardless of what he believed he could move no faster than the nation was ready to accept change.  If Lincoln were alive today and asked about colonization my guess is he would have some amusing self-deprecating story about bad ideas and tell us that is all he could politically come-up with at the time that most whites would find acceptable.  You have to give the man credit for self-assessment and knowing limitations; when most black leaders of the day told him it was a bad idea and they wouldn't support it, he dropped it.  Blacks one that argument, stopped a bad idea, and changed the course of history all because of the man named Lincoln.  How many white men in power at that time would have even listened to those blacks let alone concede their plan/policy to them?"

"Trump said from his guts 'blames on both sides'. 'This has been going on for a long time.' Trump does not know how to lie in public, yet. But he will learn soon enough, just like all other politicians in the U.S. 

Trump got hit like he is the many great enemies of U.S. around the world with his 'truth'. American never want the truth. The truth is racism, white supremacist have been the foundation of America. And still is to a large degree. Why do you think the U.S. killed more Asians after WW2 than it did before? Or during the war when killing the 'Japs' was official state command. 

American white supremacism have aligned themselves with the black slave traders of the British empire in the 19th century. After the slave trade ended they aligned with themselves, created an uniquely American white racism. KKK and others. After WW2 they aligned themselves also with Neo-Nazi. The Nazi, of course, have exterminated Jew, Gipsys, Slav because they were inferior. This thing's been around."
Agree: I was talking with a Muslim friend and I mentioned Israel. What he said after that I had not ever heard before outside of watching old news reels of Hitler. They were views on Jews that were way wide of the mainstream in Canada. I have also heard similar extreme views from Chinese Canadians on blacks as another example. Racism exists in many forms and worrying about white Canadians is really the least of the problem.
"How so?  What liberal policy mandated that black families be torn apart, and how did it do so?"
"At least you are agreeing that blacks can be racist as well.  There are many that try to deny it.   I will never say that there are not racists on BOTH sides.  I am just using the No BLM sign as speech that lefties will shutdown without a second thought.    Yet when the right tries to say anything about free speech they say that we should not have it.  If they want to say something the right might disagree with, they claim that they are just using their free speech rights."

They just don't think black people are actually American."
"wow, the pot calling the kettle black.  the issue you keep posting about has been settled, you lost, so why use it to constantly denigrate the mayor about in every comment you post no matter what the subject matter is?  this kind of behavior shows how immature you are, like a little kid than cannot accept failure.  that incident with they mayor was just a minute fractions of what he does and yet because of it, you clam he is unfit to be mayor.  in your eyes it may have been unfair, but that does not mean he is a total failure as mayor.   and now you keep defending your actions, not wanted to let it go.  this clearly shows how vindictive and malicious person your are.  I kinda feel sorry for you.

"Sorry, but it the conservatives who are afraid of their shadows.  Afraid of women, afraid of black men, afraid of people with jobs, afraid of people whose sexuality isn't like theirs, afraid of immigrants, etc. etc.

Boo!"
"JF,  There is no record of any whippings taking place.  Actually, there is virtually no record of Oregon expelling anyone.  But there is a record of law enforcement telling a blackman to leave and his white neighbors coming to his defense and the law in the end not being enforced.  I suspect the real reason blacks didn't come to Oregon prior to WWII in any significant numbers is because there was nothing for them to come to Oregon for.  I seriously doubt blacks were even aware of the law, hence not an effective deterrent for moving to Oregon and basically useless in making blacks leave if they came.

Mostly what is written about these laws are the existence of them and a lot of postulating about them."
"While constantly reminding the reader that the shooter was black, they, conveniently, left out the fact that at least one of the police killed was black.  This deliberate omission emphasizes the blackness of the perpetrator while giving the impression that only white police are being threatened.  This omission is found in every report across the corporate media.  Only social media revealed the death of a young, black, police father from this sniper."
"Next you'll be sending me Holocaust denial propaganda.  

I won't argue with anyone who makes the absurd claim that America is suddenly full of racists.  I find it hateful and insulting, and given that this country has voted twice for a Black president, absurd.  

This column is just spreading lies, and hatred."
"I believe the problem in Chicago is much the same as in most over sized cities. Too many folks and not enough jobs! To blame blacks for not reforming or policing themselves is an empty notion. No culture that I'm aware off, ever polices itself. Kind of the same thing that most professions won't police themselves either!  A crazy world, huh?"
"rangerMC, sane people are trying to uphold national goals and national identity, which is everyone is equal. you and yours are trying to make national goals and identity white only, because you think white has an inherent right to rule because whites are better than anyone else. when i was a kid, you were the schoolyard bullies but we called you snarfs. you haven't changed much since the 50s, except now you can carry ar15s to intimidate others because your physique sure doesn't. oh yeh, those statues you talked about in another post, those were put up to reinforce jim crow laws in the 1900s and civil rights laws in the 50s. they are not historical anything, they were just to bully blacks and keep white control. suck it up racist."
"Sorry Steven, don't see how that's racist.  Obama (whose name backwards in Latin means 'I will love', and might be intepreted as vaguely lecherous) had an non-American father.  If he'd been, say, Slovenian, the level of suspicion concerning his citizenship would have been the same.  
Of course, Melania was Slovenian, and her name comes from the Greek μελαινα, which means black, or to the medically inclined (as 'melaena'), 'black stool resulting from an upper GI bleed'.  So if Trump were a racist, would he marry someone whose name means 'black'?  That's civil marriage, of course, because it was his third. 
Anyway, getting back to football, this afternoon I watched the local second XV take on Tunbridge Wells.  None of this ridiculous overspecialisation of American football--offence, defence, special teams--and no Darth Vader suits either.  Just a bunch of sweaty men jumping on top of each other.  Building a bridge, as it were.  And mercifully free of kneeling controversies."
"I'm all for the death penalty for violent rapists, but what did Trump do? Groping in a public place? Punch him in the face like I teach my daughter to and let him know it's not allowed (if indeed it isn't - some of you girls are OK with it, you know). Don't spend your life anguishing over the injustice. Boys/men are pigs. If you're an adult woman and are surprised by this, I point you toward all of human history. Henry the VIII, JFK, Bill, and every rock star you can think of. Alpha males get away with more, because the tribe figures he's the most fit, and he should have more kids than the rest of us losers. This will make the tribe stronger. Not all Alphas are so worthy, of course, but broadly speaking....

"Well then, you and the Black Riders have something in common, hatred of Obama and belief that Obama is a racist. Absurd.

I haven't heard anything about Black Riders, probably because they haven't killed anyone or done anything else to get in the news.

But please, no opinions from the Rush Limbaugh types."
"You're a fool, manoafishserwhiteracist.  This just wasn't any demonstration. It was being held by the KKK and Nazis.  Stop spouting the Fox news BS and realize that, yes, they have a right to protest, but we should relegate them to a cage in a zoo to do their rallies. Fortunately, we might be able to do this ""for the kkk/Nazi's protection.  I bet a lot of people wished they had fought back against Hitler in 1932, and the KKK after the Civil War.  We cannot pretend this is just another protest, and for you to see it as such labels you as another KKK/Nazi/Fox News Stooge.   While you think your comment is balanced, it outs you as a Nazi sympathizer.  I just bet you're one of the MAGAphants that were outraged by the Black Lived Matter protests.

"Males who identify as transgender are winning against females in cycling, weight lifting, basketball...and taking scholarships to college from females.  Blokes in frocks can be transgender, foine, they do NOT become women because of their feelings and personality preferences.

Physiology confers benefit to males in muscle fiber, O2 carrying, bone structure...and, it's disgusting to see a Fallon Fox end the career of a black female boxer inside a couple of minutes in the ring - smashed her eye orbit.  Many fans were there to see black lesbian get beat badly by a guy.

This is not sportsMANlike.  Transgender should compete with each other not against the opposite sex. 

I think we have like one female who identifies as transgender winning against males - mostly this is natal males showing up female athletes.  

If female athletes don't boycott, we might need to hit advertisers.  Women earned Title IX for a reason, it's being destroyed by genderists."

Anybody who claims JBS is anti-Semitic is a shameless liar or an absolute fool. Mr. Thiessen, who has deep links to white nationalism and the promotion of ""racist pseudo-science"" via his employer according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, also cites a known white supremacist who wanted to deny voting rights to black people as the supposed ""excommunicator"" of the John Birch Society from the ""respectable right.""

The fact that after all of this she wants them to return is what is incredulous.  She invited them, kicked just the black half out and then requested he return?  Uh yeah ok... This isn't a private property issue it's clearly a social disconnect issue. 

She insulted the man and actually had the nerve to comment on his ability to speak well?  Why because he's black she's surprised he was able to conduct himself intelligently? It's those comments that make her look like an arse. 

The real point is being overlooked and that's the problem."

Unless we can now identify as white if we're black, or brown if we're yellow.  How should one ""get to the bottom"" of these conundrums?.....Hmmmm.....maybe courts?  I'm waiting for the logical conclusion stages where males will ""self identify"" as females and kick all the girls butts in girls track, or wrestling or judo.  Can you imagine all the gold medals?  Then when they're done, they can just ""re-identify"" as males and move on.  That'll be a Netflix movie soon...you watch!"
"Truman was nominally a member of the Klan, from 1920 to 1922, between two and three years.

Truman was pro-Catholic and Pro-Jewish, which put him at odds with the Klan.  McKinley was an Ohio Republican, when the Klan was Southern and anti-Republican.  Wilson was racist but there is no record he ever was a member of the Klan.  Harding took a strong anti-Klan stance and appointed Blacks to federal offices.

"You make a valid point intellectually. But it stinks to make it an issue as it's been the formal mode of address since the USA was founded. The military is an entirely different creature in America, (i.e. we Americans have never had a military takeover). We choose our leaders by vote.

Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster. Then mix-in our polarized and factionalized politics and beware of a nationwide explosion… IMO, we all need to work together to try to de-escalate things… with hope, Gary Crum"

We would do well to remember 'white man's burden' and 'manifest destiny'.  Let's just not speak these things out loud, let's just quietly go back to appointing all white males to everything.

"In July of 2016, an avowed black nationalist murdered five police officers during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Dallas, Texas. The act of violence was well-planned and was motivated entirely by the hate-filled ideology of the shooter, Micah Xavier Johnson.

With several officers dead by the hand of a committed black nationalist, one might think the Obama administration may have considered the assassinations domestic terror and launched an investigation into groups associated with this ideology.

Not at all.

The have become aloof, defending the indefensible, treating citizens like idiots and dismissing genuine concerns of citizens because those concerns are regarded as not affecting the ""masses which simply mans that ordinary people are not concerned about a collapsing economy, rampant corruption and indifferent politicians.Cyril, if you want usto take you seriously, you will have to say something radically different...and so far you have not even stated."
"Isn't racism foundational to these groups:  KKK, Nazis, white supremacy?  What  ""values"" do they espouse other than racism?  The KKK has been terrorizing and killing blacks for 150+ years.  Nazis in Europe exterminated millions of Jews and other marginalized groups in the 1930-40's.  ""White"" supremacy indicates racism in its very name.  

What spin are you offering instead of these FACTS, ""Buster?"""
"""White Americans tend to put greater faith in the police than their minority counterparts do; only about 44 percent of Hispanics and African-Americans give the police positive reviews. Americans 55 and older are also more likely to trust the police. ""

This shows the racial divide in this country.  A demagogue, Trump, exploited it to get in the White House."
"""When Black Americans take a knee to exercise their First Amendment rights to protest racism and police brutality, Trump calls them “sons-of-bitches.”
When an African-American kills one and wounds seven others in a Tennessee church recently, scarcely a word in GM. It is now being investigated as a hate crime. Its a story with far more impact than the antics of a few overpaid athletes. Its interesting how easily sheeple are manipulated by the over abundance or lack of information."
"Of course they blame Trump.  So silly.

They said it just had to be a white Trump supporter who burned that Black church.  Turned out it was a parishioner.  Who was Black, and democrat.

All those Muslim women who said men assaulted them because they were Muslim.   Turned out all their stories fell apart, and they admitting to lying.

Now this, and of course the usual reactionaries make stuff up to smear everyone who didn't vote for Hillary.   Sorry gang, but it doesn't quite follow that the supporters of the guy who is super pro Israel would go on a terror spree against Jews.

And of course, the usual people have made up their minds that everyone who isn't a Prog is a member of the KKK.

What a sad bunch some of you are."
"I am sorry but everywhere - and I mean everywhere - in the Western world, the majority of urban shootings and murders are perpetuated by black males. No matter the country's history, culture, language spoken, food habits etc. the story remains the same. This problem will not be resolved with more money for social programmes or more BLM demos making the spurious claim that police are killing black youth. 

It is a cultural problem and one that only blacks themselves can resolve.  Canada did not have the same slavery history as the US yet the American experience is used as an excuse for black failure in Canada. The black community needs to learn from other immigrants and succeed as others have done: through hard work, obey the law, and carry themselves with dignity."

That one thing is devision of the races. This man should be ashamed to use the title of Reverand. How about the video of Al that is available on the internet where he calls for black people to go out and kill white people. Your not fooling anyone anymore you tax cheating fraud."
"This was a racist shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black cop. Where are the ""White Lives Matter"" demonstrators?"

"intolerance  comes in all colors.  How would it be , we cast a TV series about Martin Luther King with a white person playing Mr King ? We really need to get over our selves here.

It demeans everything our great black leaders have done to fight real racism."

"Trump is a racist, plain and simple, as he's demonstrated repeatedly. It's not disrespecting the flag or the country or anything else to take a knee in protest over police killings that go unpunished, which started the protest movement in the NFL and which continues to be a stain on our nation today. Black Lives Matter is about cops killing unarmed African-Americans for no justified reason, not the other way around. Anyone casual reader of the news can see that. Only those who tolerate unequal treatment and taking away civil liberties support Trump. We didn't fight wars so people could stand for the national anthem. They were fought to preserve democracy and the constitutional right to protest against government policy. The NFL players who are exercising that right are more doing their patriotic duty to ensure there really is ""justice for all."""
That was one ridiculous article.  The BLM posters at BC should not have been damaged but destroyed.  Blacks in this country are only oppressed now because they want to be.  The Russians have nothing to do with the self oppression of the African-Amercians.
"There was virtually no media coverage of Trump's many rallies during the election.  In every  crowd, in every city, in every state were the most despis'd and curs'd white males, whom  we are told are the bane of America.    However, they were there with their wives and girlfriends who were dutifully labeled ""male"" or  simply ignored completely  There were blacks who were labelled  ""white"". and gays who were labeled racists. There were Hispanics who were classified as ""white"" or called ""ignorant "".  They all knew they were being lied to, and lied about, by everybody but Trump."
The Napoleon with a whiff of grapeshot for these black clad vandals will be arriving shortly. Mark my words.

"“…and if black guys weren't so heavily involved in violent crime…”

I’ll let you ponder that blatant bit of “not part of MY group” exclusive thinking, and how it might have affected those who are not part of “your group”… after NOT being part of YOUR “group” for the last 200 years. 
Your post is a perfect example of how white, Christian, Americans are blind to the advantages they enjoy by being white…their “white privilege”, and how they are easily exonerated from the misdeeds of their group…unlike the “…heavily involved in violent crime…” black guys, or the terrorist Muslims."
"Its really puzzling having to justify ones experience of being black in South Africa, nevermind corporate south africa. As a black businessman accessing funds to start a business venture has been a lot harder to obtain in comparison to my white counterparts. For one, there is generational wealth, assets that stand as surety as well as lets be honest...skin tone. That serves as more currency, it is supported by history and present day acturial science. To contend that acquiring business confidence is not a matter of skin colour is to believe that the holocaust did not happen, slavery did not happen, aparthied did not happen, pass laws did not happen, Group Areas act did not happen. Inequality was not just imprinted socially it was enacted as part of law. 
Structural inequality is systematically entrenched in our education, governance, legal and social fabric. It was the old boys in the boardroom with not just a Black person but a Woman but a Black woman. Amnesia does not live here."
Zuma is 7 years too late wt his radical economic transformation. we and i mean black south africans are not stupid. we are connectin the dots. the ignorant ANC leadership should be well to note that it is the middle classes that pay the bulk of taxesand it isus who cause revolutionsglthat caused uprisings.
It's sad to think that the sweet little girl in the picture will be shrouded in a black sack by her feminist mother as soon as she starts to grow breasts.
It's sad that NOT doing something stupid is considered News!  Kaaepernick was spurred into making his insane protest by his black Muslim girlfriend - clearly to advance her extreme leftist ideology which puts anarchy above freedom.
"Oh I bet you have black friends too. So slavery would of ended in it's own good time. So would've WW2., but we dropped the bomb to stop the death then and there. Tell the folks that marched wit the civil rights movement that it was unnecessary because black folks would have gotten their rights sooner or later. 
  And aunt Jemima is really someone of black heritage wants to be like, But it was really nice of her to take a job with your family when I'm sure she could have done anything else she wanted. And I bet the pay was great master

"So now, Elway and Ellis are both morons.  These guys 'WORK' for you and Denver, they, as we, are expected to do their jobs, as we are at work.  To tell this malcontent, 'I respect your decisions to disrespect our anthem and flag'  is pure nonsense.  The nfl is losing viewership, big time, and it's going to get worse.  There are other sports, where the participants love America, the anthem and flag, completely.  We do NOT need to be told once again, about how bad the blacks have it in America, the country that has done more for them than ANY other country on Earth.  Demands, entitlements, affirmative action, quotas for black hiring, extra credit on SAT scores, only for blacks, and they're complaining?  On the field?  In uniform?  Soon, I won't watch this bunch, along with the rest of the nfl."
"""But political correctness is silly, nothing more. It starts with a humane instinct, not to offend, and takes it too far. The response is to educate. For example, unless all lives matter, at any given time, any particular group's lives are in danger of not mattering. Put differently, unless all lives matter, black lives do not matter, and unless black lives matter, all lives do not matter. The response is not to create a political movement whose principal object is to be offensive.""

""...a political movement whose principle object is to be offensive."" ??? MSW, I am starting to worry for you."
"Problem is white people don't know what to think.  They vote for a two term black president - that's pretty color blind and a good thing.  But then they see the footage of the Milwaukee riots.  Here's a situation where a black cop kills a black man.  Appears to be justified, not 100% sure yet.  Response from that community?  Burning, looting, torching vehicles including police cars.  Young thugs by the dozens burning down their own community black businesses.  Hard for whites to understand and even harder for blacks to defend."
"Because as far as color goes, the dominant gene is the black gene and the child will not look white.  It is also because of a bias against blackness by some groups.  If a child has a certain percent of black heritage, they are considered black.  This is not at all unusual nor limited to black and white.  It is a way of preserving culture, hence a child with a Jewish father but a Christian mother is not considered Jewish.  Bias is not always about hating something.  It is about a love of something too.   That Obama was scarred says more about his lack of proper upbringing than about racism.  He should have been taught to love himself and his enemies and to overcome evil with good rather than vengeance."
"And so tonight the filthy, racist, criminal president has pardoned the filthy, racist, criminal ex-sheriff for the sheriff's long, public, defiant violation of the human, political and civil rights of persons with black and brown skin. Despicable.

 “What am I supposed to do if I don’t like him and I don’t trust her?” a millennial black woman in Ohio asked. “Choose between being stabbed and being shot? No way!”

“She was part of the whole problem that started sending blacks to jail,” a young black man, also from Ohio, observed about Mrs. Clinton.

“He’s a racist, and she is a liar, so really what’s the difference in choosing both or choosing neither?” another young black woman from Ohio said."

"Emry is still benefiting from white privilege. If he were black and had threatened to kill law enforcement officers with an illegal 50 caliber machine gun, he would not have survived his arrest. White cops have killed black children for less. Remember Tamir Rice."
"""If Trump opposed racism, he would hardly be calling for the firing of black athletes who take a small symbolic step to protest racial violence against people of colour""
He did't. He said ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that SOB off the field right now, out, he's fired""
YOU'VE decided to make it about BLACK athletes. Add an extra word here, an extra word there - as long as it supports your narrative, right?"
So it's your contention that because blacks were oppressed for so long they get a pass when they brutalize a white person for being white? How long does this 'pass' last?
Unlike the 1/3 black president that lurks in the shadows?

"“This not guilty verdict of a police officer who violently killed a citizen is another slap in the face to the black community in St. Louis. And a shot in the heart to the family of the victim,” Missouri State Rep. Michael Butler, D-St. Louis, said in a statement issued Friday morning, adding that the verdict has left him “appalled.”

Too bad Mr. Butler isn't appalled by the actions of the member of the black community who placed numerous citizens, residents and law enforcement officers in harms way.  Don't attack police officers with a deadly weapon (the car) while carrying another deadly weapon and you have virtually a 100% chance of surviving every encounter with law enforcement.  Pretty simple actually. Maybe Mr Butler's oratory ""skills"" could be put to better use employing the black community to be better members of their community instead of lawless thugs.  Nah, doesn't fit the victim narrative of the progressives . . ."
"YES. They are.
Btw, May I ask you is ""Nationalism"" Bad in your opinion? Not White Nationalism, just plain ""Go USA-type"" Nationalism.

There is a world of difference between the contrition of a former KKK member and the current debate over the removal of confederate statues that were mostly erected during the Jim Crow era in order to reassert white supremacy in the wake of defeat during the Civil War and which are still a painful reminder to millions of black people of the pain and suffering their ancestors endured under the oppressive system championed by the subjects of those statues.

Nothing crosses the Integrity Line with Clinton supporters.  No, she is female, the ends justify the means: we must at all costs elect a female.  Even if she has a rapist husband who will move back into the White House, with even more, private, access.

"Because black on black crime is the direct root of the police contacts and injuries.  Black shootings by the police are a symptom of black on black crime.  Gangs kill each other and sell drugs and other crimes, the police respond to those crimes as demanded by the community.  The police get no cooperation from the community and have to contact yet even more people to identify who is involved.  That contact infuriates those people and you get confrontation which leads to more injuries.  Is it not that straight forward, nah it has to be a bunch of cops who are racist."

"Yes, my posts - the audacity of innocent before proven guilt outside of conviction in the court of popular mob opinion - are absolutely biased and intolerable.

And playing the race card isn't an argument. Go tell your neo-Marxist school teachers they failed to teach you basic reasoning.

Btw, you may want to consider why your standards are doubled based on race. In what situation would you allow people to smear an accused black person of guilt before proven innocent, without bothering to inquire of his side of the story? Yes, there is a racist here, indeed..."
"Lots of evidence Ghandi was a racist himself.  He certainly supported the caste system..you know  where certain people were forced to carry brooms...to erase their tracks..because they were so ""disgusting"".  Read about the ""untouchables"".   While you're at it I'd like to point out that whites outnumber blacks in the U.S. by 5-1. Yet blacks commit eight times as many crimes against whites as the reverse...and let's not forget about interracial rapes as they're almost exclusively black on white.  If racism is the ugliest manifestation of what's going on in Charlottesville, what does this tell us about where racism really resides?  We don't live in the Jim Crow South any longer.  The faux-cry of ""racism"" is nothing more than a cudgel used to create the illusion of victimization and sew divisiveness for political and monetary gain."
"I've lived in Shaker Hts., Ohio. The vast majority of the Jews that I have met have been friendly, thoughtful, humanitarians. Swerner and Goodman were murdered with Chaney for registering black folks to vote in Philadelphia, Mississippi, in the 1960's. Their martyrdom was important enough for Ronald Reagan to launch his successful run for president with a speech there. The white crowd loved his speech. None of them were fans of the dead. His speech was a brilliant strategy to recruit the white racists to the GOP."
"There is a level of hypocrisy evident, but that hypocrisy is very far removed from the real gratitude towards a group that welcomed them when the rest of the world turned their backs on them in their time of need. My grandmother voted Nat until the day she died, and while I disagreed with her it was hard to argue that she should change her vote.

It's the same reason so many white folk are perplexed that black voters in SA continue to vote for the ANC despite how clearly corrupt and self-serving they are. I view it in the same light - bringing SA out of apartheid buys a lot of goodwill, and it's hard to tell someone that the same flag that literally fought for and won your freedom is no longer in your corner.

I have no easy answers, but it doesn't help anyone to get reductive and forget the human elements."
Rap creation was funded by high level freemasons to destroy the black culture. In the past black families were close and religious. That needed destroyed. Black men were radicalized to get them jailed and removed from the home. The women and children were then enslaved by the welfare state. tinyurl.com/HipHopOrigin
"The Jewish media doesn't consider anyone except the Hillary-voting city tards to be ""Americans.""

"Racism, sexism and discrimination in general has always and will always exist.  People rise above their detractors and gain their respect.  In this manner the barriers are broken down and, one by one, eliminated.
When Obama was elected the annual poll of black America showed that discrimination was not their greatest impediment but rather a lack of education.  Throughout his Presidency, Obama has cried racism at every turn.  Time and again it turns out he was incorrect.  It seems he is just crying, ""wolf,"" to draw ignorant people away from the truth.

Who can't admire a successful person?  Actually the Left political wing hates successful women and  minorities as it destroys their narrative that they need to take care of everyone.  In the narrative of the Left, women and other minorities are incapable of much of anything and need to be taken care of by a benevolent government."
"Black voters across America didn’t vote for a rich privileged white lady.   And for many white middle class Americans, she was just Obama's left overs.  Much of her support was actually just anti-Trump."

"To solve a problem we need to see the whole picture and admit the bitter truth that hoaxes and false-flag incidents happen.

Exactly how much patience and forgiveness do white people need from minorities in general and black folks in particular? It is not like Africans stole white people from Europe to rape and make us rich, like white folks did to us. Heck, the country still benefits from that history. The Ivy League was financed by the slave trade, for example. Today, I'll settle for equal protection under the law. Our criminal justice system has failed to deliver that.

"Muslims are a minority with a particular potential to change the face of this country in a hurry. Precedents abound. Quebec is making a clear and reasonable statement that it will not submit to ideologies, religions or foreign cultures. The requirement to show one's face is hardly onerous.

In Canada, wearing a religious mask or covering your entire body, head to toe, in a black sack is an extreme act of religious expression, and one that underscores a desire to be apart from, rather than part of, Canadian society. Please, just a moment of common sense ... Is it any wonder that such ridiculous and provocative garb evokes negative sentiment?"
"Clearly, the man that was shot didn't follow the officers instructions. He was ordered to stop and go to his knees for 15 seconds before he ended up getting shot. That is 15 seconds he decided to NOT follow the officers orders. No, that isn't punishable by death, but if he reached into the car after 15 seconds of disobeying, then that is.

I believe the black community is stuck in a cycle that they need help to get out of (better education, etc). That being said, they still make the decisions they do that perpetuate the cycle. The black community as a whole needs to take control of their community and work together to fix items within their control. Remember, they decide(statistically as a group) to drop out of school, have kids at a young age, not go to college, or not to obey an officers orders. I've known many black men that chose to go to college and better their lives. They are the same men that choose to obey an officer. They are very successful as well, because they chose to be!"

"Advances in merit and social equality in society have been demotions for poorly educated white folks. They are angry about losing the white privilege they claim doesn't exist. They can't even get away with murdering black folks in church any more, like they could in the 1960's. I always thought that American Exceptionalism was just mythology to let them think they were an important part of America's success. I suspect a lot of those guns they have will end being used in murder suicides of many of their families along with other self destructive behaviors they do. Their choices are the reasons why they are the only demographic that is dying younger. They refuse to take responsibility for their choices. They think they are victims. The police don't even profile them. I would pity them if they were not armed and dangerous."
"It's not a straw man. My point is that your statement that people have a right not to feel threatened just doesn't fly. People's feelings are their business. On the other hand, if somebody actually is being threatened, rather than just feeling threatened, that is a matter of public concern.

I also don't agree that the black students don't have objectively reasonable grounds to believe they are being threatened. They have a fellow (white) student who posted  ""images that included nooses drawn around the necks of a black student and coach"". That particular student and coach are directly threatened; it is not unreasonable to extrapolate the threat to all black people at that school."

I live in a nice neighborhood, but it's not the Preserve in Greenwood Village. I can't afford to live there. Luckily, the fact that I couldn't afford to grow up there didn't hurt my ability to get a decent education. Of course, I'm white.

"""This is Oregon.  This is not who we are""""

Absolutely true.  From the time Oregon became a Territory in 1849 we have NEVER had a Territorial or State official assassinated.  You have to go clear back to 1844 to dig up the killing of  George Lebreton, Clerk and Recorder of the Provisional Government  who was shot and killed   in the famous  ""Cockstock Afair"" as he tried to break up a fight between an Indian and a black person over a dispute over a horse.  We've never had such troubles again until recently when  a paranoid collection of bullies began making outrageous threats of violence upon our leaders.

"Racial profiling is institutional racism. If profiling were a valid police policy, angry white men with guns would be profiled. They kill many more cops than black people. Blacks are killed by cops for the mere suspicion of being armed.

White people don't get randomly stopped and frisked. The 2nd Amendment is a white privilege when ever white cops are involved. We can discuss housing discrimination and employment discrimination. They all still exist too."

This museum is only for blacks, yet everyone is supposed to feel like it's ""about them, too?"" How crass is Page trying to be, here?  ""The story is about blacks, but it's about everyone?""  How utterly hilarious.

The inconvenient truth for John Lewis and Clarence Page is that the black community IS in the worst shape it's ever been  (""Black Community"" to mean freed, non-slave, voting, non-segregated members of the larger American society, as was meant by Trump, so no- not in the same world whatsoever as when none of these things were the case with African slaves)."
"Actually, it is the other way around.  The Dallas police killings happened because of the murders of two black men in Baton Rouge and Minnesota by racist white police officers this past week.  The Dallas shooter Micah Johnson made it most clear in his phone conversations with police that was the reason for his attack.   

Do you honestly think that the Dallas incident would have happened, if those two black men had not been executed??

If white police officers continue to gun down black people like this, no one will be surprised if more blacks don't decide to retaliate.  This cycle of violence has to end.  

And it was most definitely NOT Black Lives Matter that inspired Johnson to kill.  All other press reports say that he was a follower of the group called the African American Defense League, which is on Facebook.   AADL specifically called for black people to kill white policemen this week.  Look at their Facebook page:

"Yet again, black blindness.  They refuse to recognise the colossal, exponential increase in the black population of Cape Town. When I first arrived there,  in 1976,  only Gugs and Nyanga existed as black townships, and there was a tiny population of about 1000 blacks.   Cape Town's population was mainly white and coloured   In the months before the first free elections,  the ANC were bussing in between 20 and 30, thousand blacks a month, from the Eastern Cape.  Go check.  And the increase in black numbers  has never stopped since.  So, how is any city expected to cope with such a colossal increase.  The drought is not just because of the lack of rain.  It has been caused by the huge increase in the city's numbers."
And it doesn't meet Shill's apologist announced standards that the honoree has to be black.
"And while you ignore the endless numbers of black and brown racists and varying shades of neo-Marxist, Marxist, and in between that have been in the DNC for decades. Same old one-sided pseudo-outrage."
"We should condemn all white, black supremacy, or any group ( of color and ideology ) for that matter that promotes racial hatred, bigotry and violence in our society."
"Being butthurt that Bernie lost the primary isn't the same as black men and women being racially targeted, abused, harassed and murdered."
So will they come to the Stratford Festival and protest about the use of black actors in traditionally white roles?
"Part of Trumps claim is the media being so obviously biased and neglecting to report Hillary's corrupt and unethical behaviors nearly enough. That is undeniably correct ! That's called deception: Altering perception without reflecting other (negative) pertinent facts about Hillary.  Trump will win because of this disturbing nonsense on a national scale with the mainstream media.  How about reporting the Tracey Martin claim of Hillary calling a black man the ""N"" word when Tracey was a chef for the Clinton's years ago in the White House ? That's right ! Tracey Martin reported that Hillary angrily called a black man the N word when she did'd get what she asked for. His accusation is just as credible as every woman attacking Trump but Mr. Martin gets no coverage? At least for now but this story will come out very very soon. And Hillary calling Robert Byrd her friend and mentor after his death. Robert Byrd was the KKK leader folks. Lets get real ADN !"
our first half white president?  black privilege?
"Well, sesame negro, the usual ploy to kill the messenger when refusing to acknowledge the truth of the comments.  The reverse racism ploy of the White Supremacist ideology claiming victim hood while perpetrating maximum violence.  Not worthy of any answers to inane, insane questions from the pea brain devoid of intelligence, logic or reason."
"Your probably part of the America that does not understand that America has a history past an present of pissing on Natives, Blacks, Chinese, Japanese etc. etc.. so understandably there are people of all walks of life that feel free to exercise their freedom as Americans to protest."
"Blacks oppress themselves.  58 percent graduation rate from DPS hahahaha!  Of those, maybe 20 percent go to college and maybe five percent graduate with a degree in sociology.  They have a thinking problem.  Very low IQ."
Note that one of the officers was Timothy Hunt. He was the one who beat up Sophie Bray on May 12 for renting a room to a black guy. EPD missed the chance to get rid of one of their bad apples when the internal affairs officer ruled that he followed EPD procedures in the beating.
"I’m not espousing anti-American bigotry nor demonstrating it. Bigotry is when you don’t like something that you are ignorant of. Like how white Americans have a bigoted view of black Americans, Indigenous Americans, Muslim Americans, Mexican Anericans, Dreamers, etc
THATs bigotry.

So no, the reason I have a negative opinion about America is because I know all about America. That’s not bigotry. That’s just good old fashioned Canadian intelligence.

"""*When people say I hate rap you know what they are really saying.*""

....That they hate rap?

""*Yet their kids are running around sagging*""

Trust me: if they're sagging, then they're not ""running around"" anywhere.

""*Don’t hate! White America invented rap-Dr. Seuss,*""

In the first place, I dare you to declare to a black man that ""whites invented rap.""  In the second place, rhyming and poetry are not the same thing as rap.

""*...and invented sagging-plumbers.""

Um- no. Sagging was invented in jails by black men.  I'll let you Google it to find out the rest of the sordid details."
"With his legacy of ""regime change"" in the Middle East, the destabilization of other governments, hundreds of thousands of needless deaths and the displacement of millions of people, it's a good bet that a lot of people won't miss the Obamas at all. 

Gerald Caplan's racial double standard is transparently hypocritical. He implies that it is racist for a majority of white Americans to vote for a white candidate but doesn't question the fact that black Americans voted by an even greater margin for a black Presidential candidate. Using Caplan's logic, is that not also a manifestation of racism?"
"Or try this on for size: And so it will remain until employers are prohibited from discriminating based on a criminal record. Republicans love to discriminate in hiring someone, whether it be blacks, Hispanics, women, old people, or those with criminal records. Then they wonder why people are homeless and on welfare. Not smart, Republicans."
"Trump rally ?

The black guy saved the world economy and tripled the markets in only 8 years.
The S&P 500 went from under 700 to over 2,200.


Why does a white guy get the credit ?"
I work in their sports dept. all the coaches obsessed with some new fifty shades type book called 22's Diary. I think their crazy like in book preparing them for sex with big black guys.
Contrast this with what happens if a crazy black person goes on a rampage and gets shot and killed by police.  No riots.  No calls of racism.  No crazy marches and calls to fire policemen.  Hmm.
"I was wondering who got the $5.00.  Sort of like a poll tax for access to the candidates, I guess.  Worked to keep those 'uppity Negroes' in the South from voting; limits those who can actually hear the candidates at the same time in Eugene as well."
"Most Confederate soldiers were drafted to fight a rich man's war. Same then as today. The slave owners were the elite 1% and could buy their way out of service. 

Doesn't mean that monuments to the Confederacy aren't stomach churning for the Americans you don't even pause a moment to consider, the descendants of the slaves (and the persecuted racial minority long after the Emancipation Proclamation). These monuments are slaps in the face.

Save me your crocodile tears for the white supremacists and their statues. Many of these monuments and the embrace of the Confederate flag took place in the 20th century as a response to civil rights progress, not as some tribute to Cletus McCannonfodder who fought a war for slave owners even though ol' Cletus didn't even have a pot to p-- in. 

White supremacy an divide & conquer are what has kept poor whites hating poor blacks for the benefit of rich whites for too long. Enough. Stop venerating white supremacy. Erect statues of Nat Turner instead."
"Why are the white guys telling the blacks that their protests are no good, that the protests make the white guys sick because the black people are telling the white guys, that those policies of racial injustice, the stand your ground laws, the deliberate imprisonment of people of color, for crimes they did not commit. For the most part the supporters of the draconian laws and policies against people of color, claim to be Christians,
So as a Native who experienced racism first hand.. The thought of you all going to your Christian heaven seems a bit far fetched. That you all going to your rapture makes as much sense as the Mideast terrorists going to their Islamic heavens with their 72 virgins, after making life as miserable to people of color. Life on this earth is just momentary compared to the other journeys we make, but I am sure your Christian jesus will have a good talk with you all, before or after he whips you into limbo, purgatory or the hell all racists deserve."
He also forgot to denounce black racists like BLM and socialist fascist brown shirts who attacked the peaceful protesters who had permits
"What's really creepy is your referring to the previous President as ""the black guy""."
"If you're going to show the assailants as black, then you owe it to readers to show the victim as white."

"I would bet that that cop fired all three shots at the white guy, and missed ... clipping the black guy by accident!"
"Even if he thought he was going to hell, it would not be the State's concern.
No more so than if a white business owner in the Old South thought he was going to hell if he served blacks."
"No doubt about it, those were seriously disturbed people marching in Virginia today. KKK and all the other weirdo white power groups along with the ANTIFA and black power groups but so what? Each is as bad as the other and theyre all just using that statue as an excuse to go and bust heads and spout off.  One side is rightfully maligned though while the other is portrayed as almost heroic by our press and left leaning supporters...Probably for fear of being labelled as white supremacist if they speak out against them."
"Political Correctness a euphemistic conglomerate for courtesy, respect, and other virtues has been smashed which of course is true vis a vis Dr. Strange-Glove (up your crotch) south of the boarder.  I've seen the film Dear White People and it's a gas. Only those white people (I'm white) who feel their 'privileged' threatened would complain.  Racism is a false god and the sooner people understand that the better we are. Why? Because of the legacy of racial terror that has been inflicted upon blacks especially but also the children of the First Nations who were torn from their families and forced to dwell in residential schools, mostly hotbeds of sexual and physical abuse, violence and toxic stress.  Racists are haters. Haters are capable of murder. Thus the lynching tree."
"And then there are the hard realities that nobody wants to hear. RW Johnson pulls no punches in his analysis http://politicsweb.co.za/opinion/how-do-you-explain-your-own-role-in-all-this in which he describes the majority of our current political leaders as parasitic and the ANC as looters of state coffers for 23 years. How do build an economy on that - or anything else? Only liars and thieves can thrive in such an environment. So why are there still honest hard working people left in SA and why do they still pay their taxes? Maybe because they foolishly cling to a hope of nation building. One South African nation. Maybe it is because they believe there are a few black leaders in this country who are different. A few black men and women who have the right stuff. Black leaders that have integrity, that can see through BS and move beyond the divisions of the past. You Mr Jonas is one of them."
"Don't bait white supremacists. And roll eyes the moment some WASP mentions ""political correctness"" as they're sure to say something really dumb like ""What's wrong with blackface? I wouldn't be offended if some black guy went around in whiteface.""

Dear White People, why are you so threatened by a light comedy called Dear White People? Do you feel guilty about something? Do you see colour first when you interact with people of colour? Do you stereotype?

Some ask what I'd say about a show called Dear Black People. I dunno. Tell me about it. What would it be about? Would it be about a man explaining why he joined the KKK? Would it explain why Obama's skin colour upset so many members of the Tea Party? I'm asking, because I don't think the haters have thought it through"
"So the Black Nationalists, the Jewish Nationalists, The Native Nationalists, the Muslim Nationalists, the Feminists Nationalist etc. All those groups that openly play identity politics are ok, just fine but when some white people start to playing the same game they are evil nazi's!"
"The usual revised/false definitions to further the cause of the fascist traitors regurgitating the Limbaugh dictionary of invented definitions for maximum effect.  You are a racist.  You are a fascist.  You are an Old South Rebel preferring the Stars and Bars to the Stars and Stripes.  Totalitarianism comes in many forms, but, like your base ideology, dedicated to the control over others for self satisfaction through assault, torture, and murder.  Nothing in your anti-commie rants has anything to do with either sanity or intelligence.  Human rights and civil rights are anathema to your black soul."
"I don't understand why pointing out the obvious seems to trigger people such as yourself. 


I suspect it's easier to engage in hairsplitting about how Donnie is not exactly like Hitler or Mussolini, or what is different about right wing authoritarians that support Donnie vs. those that supported fascists of the past, rather than confronting what your party has become, and either working to FIX IT, or find another party to affiliate with - I think to ignore it is to put our country in peril, and so I won't ignore it, and I WILL NOT stop speaking plainly about it, no matter how politically incorrect you and others like you seem to find it.


BTW, many of the skinheads, Breitbarters and 4channers very much want those they consider the enemy (gays, blacks, Jews, Hispanic, Asian, non-xtians, union members, and ""liberals"" - meaning, anyone who does not give full throated support to their Idiot God, including ""cuckservatives"", to be subjected to the worst that the Third Reich had to offer."
"Thanks, ATF.  I see his suggestion as a two-sided coin, one side where any progression and inclusion of women is good and the other as one more way for women to be both separate and still not equal.  

Although racism and sexism in the US are still horrific problems, how much worse would they be today had voting rights not been extended to blacks and women, where all the provisions of the Civil Rights Act had been tempered so fully participatory meant ""advisory,"" where rampant racial discrimination was still legal in employment, educational, housing, etc., policies and practices?  I don't think the examples are extreme.  Discrimination is discrimination, no matter the traditions or rationales used to prop it up.  

I don't get why THEY don't get it.  What keeps them so freaking blind, even when men like this Cardinal obviously have valuable viewpoints on other issues (and even tangentially on this one)?  The obvious just eludes them, and it puzzles as well as infuriates me."

""Make America Great Again"" -

Refers to the period when America was really, really, unbelievably, terrifically great .........for white males.

Of course it wasn't so great for everyone else - women, minorities, gays, blacks, non-Christians.

White males (of which I am one) have to get over their aversion to a new social order in which all are treated equally and being a white male does not automatically guarantee you access to the front of the line ahead of those who don't share your gender, race and orientation."
"“That’s the number I need to take out [congresswoman] Cathy McMorris Rodgers. And they’re on track.” 

“Take out”? Like the Bernie Bro did when he tried to massacre Republican congressmen? Like when Democrat supported black masked Anti-Fa thugs bludgeon people with whom they disagree? Maybe more violent rhetoric, threats and actions from Democrats are the way to go. Good luck with that.

“It’s a matter of losing by less.” 

Losing by less still makes you a loser. Maybe when Democrats lose they should get a government funded participation trophy."
"Except thats not what I said.  I said many movements start with agendas.  This movement relates to discrimination - which in this country, there has been PLENTY of, especially towards blacks.  That is why often in cases that involve movement, and discrimination (in THIS country), black people are often used as a reference.  No one is saying the movements are the same or even close to equal - but both movements involved people discriminiating against them because they are ""different"" from what white Christians often refer to as ""normal""."
"I agree with Ms Wente about many things but not about this. 

If anything Obama was the opposite of meritocratic. He himself has a resume so devoid of real life experience as to be stunning that he was even in the game for the presidency. His policies and behavior as president were that of a socialist ideologue, not a liberal democrat. His unwillingness to engage with Capitol Hill speaks to an aloofness of both thought and behavior, not ""coolness"". He swept in on the dreams of many for hope and change and proceeded to fan the flames of race baiting, entitlement and social division. And his behavior since Trump's election can only be described as small and petty as he counts out his last days. 

I was glad when America elected a black man as president. It's just so sad they elected this black man."
"The advancement of human civilization to the modern world in which we now live is due predominately to Western civilization developed by white people.  That's just fact, not racism or due to a system of beliefs that white people are superior.

Sure there are white supremists and white racists (and black racists), but let's not start attacking legitimate success of a person just because of his skin color.  White people elected a black man to the highest office in the nation; admitting that he did a lousy job by white people is less racist than pandering and saying he did a good job just because he was black.

I know, I know, ""uncivil.""  The truth isn't always what you want it to be."
"If this DB is allowed to discriminate against gays what is next?  ""I don't serve African Americans or Latinos because my religion says they are sinners""  where does it stop?  ""Oh you have been divorced and now your remarrying?  Can't do it, bible says divorce is a sin"".  This guy is just a homophobe and probably a bigot and anti semite as well.  If you don't want to serve half the populace then don't go into business."
"And Risqué put WOODWARD in caps in his post. But of course he is a liberal so that's OK. It's time to put our collective big boy pants on and to stop looking for reasons to be offended and upset. 2 years ago statues acknowledging a part of our very real history didn't hurt people's feelings. Even those in the Capitol that have been criticized weren't so bad when Obama was President and Pelosi was Speaker. But in a couple short years they became evil. The General Lee on The Dukes of Hazard didn't used to upset anyone except Roscoe. But almost overnight its signature Stars and Bars threw people in a panic. Otherwise respectable (I assume) made spectacles of themselves in ridiculous hats. Blacks riot-excuse me, 'protest', over a relatively small number of shootings of blacks by law enforcement, destroying neighborhoods and property, injuring people and blocking roads while ignoring the very real issue of black on black violence in any number of cities. Cowboy/girl up and deal with life."

I do not hear anyone of the aforementioned groups going into the cities, like Chicago, and bemoaning the killing of Black men by black men or trying to raise up the black community in this Country.

"How Trump's Big Fat Racist Mouth Could Put Another Nail In His Coffin
http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/books/the-high-price-of-hate.html

Trump began his presidential bid with racist speech when he stated that Mexican immigrants were drug dealers, rapists and murderers

Then he called for a Muslim Ban because he believed that only Muslims could be terrorists

He attacked a Muslim Gold Star family and assumed that the wife was not allowed to speak simply because she was a woman when the truth was that she was overcome by grief

He claimed that African American communities are filled with drug dealers and murderers to the extent that people cannot walk down the street without being shot

He refused to denounce David Duke, the most famous living KKK leader

He started the birtherism movement against our first African American president, claiming that Barack Obama was not a U.S. citizen


He repeatedly shared anti-Semitic tweets during the campaign"
"Uh, what is the problem...? For every Black kid you punish, some Asian has to be dragged out of his chair and paddled? What? What? Just say what's wrong."
"And since the real pervasive slaughter of black men is perpetrated by other black men, nothing will really change for the better. You could weed out every racist cop in the world and the slaughter will continue. Take a look at Chicago."
"One of my comments has disappeared already. To be more blunt, all black men aren't criminals, and all black mothers aren't saints."
"Again,  knowing a couple black people does not mean you can't be racist. That’s just ridiculous. And your comments prove it out - saying that all blacks are taught to hate white people is racist AF."
"I'm just so horrified & disgusted by the people - it seems it's the majority of old white racists in this country - that will view the footage & still not be horrified at a man threatening and assaulting a woman and children. I have viewed all the footage & read Spur's press release and I would have been as incensed & terrified if I was that mother. In a similar incident when a (white) man threatened me in front of my children and then tried to block me in with his car I reacted by leaping out and shouting and swearing, it was pure adrenaline and instinct, and it worked for me, it scared the man away. Not one onlooker scolded me for my language, because I am white. They immediately assumed I was under attack & came to help me. This didnt happen at Spur because in SA black women should never talk back to white men according to racist whites. 

In this country women are more likely to be raped and killed by men than any other country in the world. We know why when we read these comments."
"No defense of these scumbags at all, but serious question-where would one find the charter for 211 that explains these ""white supremacist"" principles? Yes, I'm well aware there are white supremacist prison gangs like Aryan Nation, etc. In another article, the founder indicated 211 was formed as protection against the more-numerous black and hispanic prison gangs. Does being an all-white prison gang automatically constitute a ""white supremacist"" gang? Do the BGA, MM, Surenos, Nortenos, etc, then constitute ""black/hispanic supremacist"" gangs?

Leaders of the aforementioned gangs have been spread around the country's penal system for years, to where the MM is now found in every state. Was the DOC responsible for planting those seeds, as well?"
How about being black? Are you fine with that? Something tells me deep down you are not.
"Just so you know... Another cop, a white woman this time, catapulted out of bed, found four or five steroid monsters to help and murdered another UNARMED black man for doing what he was told. Today.

Go ahead and hate rate me. It will simply show I'm right."

They can stand around w/ the black power salute, during OUR national anthem, even at an International event, but if I did a white power salute ""OH MY GOD"".  They can shoot THOUSANDS of themselves in criminal circumstances of their own making and nothing is said. But all we look at are the two or three killed illegally by cops.

"Every government is prone to tyranny unless those who are governed are diligently watchful over those who are given great power and are supposed to be serving them. This law subverts our ability to be watchful.

Conflating the civil disobedience of a group who has to date never hurt or killed anyone with radical Muslim extremists is nonsense, and most certainly not the same thing. Would you have withheld Officer Darren Wilson's name from the violent and misinformed rioters in Ferguson? Quite frankly, he was in far more danger. The principles involved are of such importance that releasing the name is imperative.

While police officers don't specifically sign up to be put in unduly dangerous positions, they know danger is part of the job. I prefer to use readily available methods of protecting them that do not carry the ongoing risk of abuse inherent in codifying a lack of accountability of our police into law. Think how such a law would go over in black neighborhoods."

"When the FBI and DOJ investigated the Ferguson, MO shooting all the facts and evidence revealed the police officer was attacked exiting his vehicle by a 300-lb assailant. The assailant attempted to seize the officer's gun. The officer shot the assailant, who was on top of the officer, in the patrol car. The MO AG Office, MO State Patrol, FBI, ATF, and DOJ all meticulously reviewed all of the evidence and cleared the officer who was defending himself during a felony assault. The assailant earlier robbed a store by physical force. 

Obama famously said that Trayvon Martin ""could've been my son or me."" The facts and evidence showed that two neighbors, Martin and Zimmerman, got into an argument that escalated into a physical assault. Zimmerman, half-Caucasian and half-Hispanic, shot and killed Martin in self-defense. So an idiotic beef between two neighbors ended up in physical violence and death. Yet DP and the MSM entire narrative is that Caucasians randomly murder black people."

He was speaking of course to his loyal xenophobes and referring to the two wankers who play ""New Black Panther Party"" dressup, standing outside a Philadelphia polling place, every four years. The media shows up for this goofy duo like it does annually for Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, PA.

Meanwhile our AJA boys fighting alongside were  valiantly proving themselves and earning respect.  That is the difference between earning respect by doing and just protesting."

Using that reason to pre-empt a judge is bigotry. It was then and it is now. It's also pretty monumentally stupid to pre-empt a judge to cater to your own/your client's irrational prejudices and risk winding up with a much worse judge for another reason. As you should know.

"Neither is my post thanking your for your reply to my comment, but the whiners voted it into oblivion anyway.  Don't care.  It's not uncivil, so I'm putting it back:

""Thank you, Sir...
apparently ""voting"" a post up or down is based on whether the voter agrees with the comment or not, as opposed to its inherent civility or lack of same, which IMHO represents failure to understand the concept of ""civility"".

The real irony is that arguments such as ""we reserve the right to refuse service"" are and have repeatedly been used to rationalize discrimination against black or native folks, and everyone in the melanistcally-challenged crowd from Lester Maddox to Robert Bork have DEFENDED such rationale. But try it on a drug-pushing WHITE guy in an Alaskan native village, and (gasp!) it's an EXISTENTIAL THREAT to the CONSTITUTION!!!!

When confronted with such hypocritical shrieking and flailing the first thing that usually comes to mind are some Bob Dylan lyrics: ""How does it FEEEEEEEEELLLLLLL?"""

"I wouldn't equate being ignorant to being a sociopath. He just doesn't understand another's perspective. Straight white males have no clue what it's like to live in a society that isn't designed for them. The statistics about actual sexual assault are alarming. Many women have experienced a man forcing himself on them in one way or another. If you're lucky enough to have avoided that you still have to deal with the daily creepy sexual advances of the men around you. In public, at work, on the street, etc. Men don't live in this world so when women raise the alarm they think ""huh doesn't seem like an issue to me"".

It's the same kind of thing with issues like police brutality and the NFL protests. Black people face an unfair police system and white people don't care, but as soon as you kneel during football there is outrage. Women claim sexual assault is rampant and men don't care, but as soon as there's a false accusation of rape there is outrage. 

Privilege is blind to perspective."

If she indeed feels the way she writes, I feel sorry for her that she has a male husband and a son.  Must suck to be surrounded by males when she hates them so much.  I am sure she's hoping that the next one is a daughter.  Too bad technology isn't yet at a point where she could choose the birth gender of her offspring.

Anyway, her thinking is very white.  Not even black and white.  Just white."
"Sigh. For the thousandth time, Black Lives Matter is and does none of the things you name. It is a peaceful group bringing attention to the systematic and institutional discrimination that has denied blacks the opportunities whites in this country have long enjoyed. Not being shot by police for the color of your skin, for example. Let's make a deal, Move On. You don't presume to speak for groups you don't even attempt to understand, and in return I will stop calling out your posts for their sheer idiocy.

"I think we have show we can be honest without being rude Bill and I appreciate that.  .  I hope we can keep working on that, (we'll probably have some bad days  LOL).

Part of racism is just natural.   Human's organize by tribe or by similar traits, most animals organize that way.   Look at other primates.  Primate groups will kill each other.

But we are the only species that has so much complexity to our society, and we live in close proximity in a lot of urban areas.  That create stress and conflict.   If the groups don't decide on common civil behavior, there will be more violence.  It's a story as old as history.

The problem with protest is that they are by nature one sided.   Hopefully, that leads to real conversation, but that's hard with racist on both sides doing nothing but shouting.

There is No equivalence in the damage down by white racism against black, versus black discrimination against whites.  That doesn't mean black racism doesn't exist."

That is what we are enmeshed in at the moment with the NFL and their totally false precept of ""social injustice"" and Cops killing blacks.  Every last bit of it is based on hot air and not an iota of factual information.  What makes it more interesting is that the simpletons accepting and spreading the lies are some of the most highly paid in the country.  Well you know what I say - I say anyone that dumb and that much of a liar shouldn't be making that kind of money, so let's see to it that they don't!  Boycott their games in person and on TV!"
"This opinion piece misses an important fact that should be checked and assumes too much.  Check to see how many people are pulled over and how many are black by these officers and by the police in that area based on percentages.  Numbers won't lie. 

Something could be legal yet still be racist.  Just like jaywalking.  Sure it is illegal.  But if they only ticket blacks in some towns and not whites the bias is clear.  This is a small reflection of what a minority deals with."

"No, 'they' made it about the flag and our national anthem. Trump didn't start this, a very overpaid football 'player' did.  They get paid ridiculous sums of money to 'play' and while taking a stand is always respectable, doing it by trashing your own country and  with the least amount of 'cost' to themselves, is not worthy of any respect. 
.
The whole grievance is centered around so-called police brutality against blacks.  There have been some cases of police killing someone who, on the surface, 'appeared' to not be a threat. But put yourself in their shoes. They are targets. They wear a uniform and are hated by all kinds of criminals from gang members to drug dealers and prostitutes.  This has to run thru their mind every minute of every hour of every day. They are human and not robots, so they 'react' with very human reflexes and emotion.  The biggest victims of violence against blacks, unfortunately,  is by other blacks and not cops.  Who will take a 'knee' for all those victims?"
"Allaha: ""Nobody said 'all.'""

You did, but maybe you're not aware that you did. These are your words: ""In 2013, A BLACK was six times more likely than a non-black to commit murder."" (Emphasis added.)

Of course you didn't mean ""all blacks,"" but by your choice of words, you imply that ANY black -- and by extension, ALL blacks -- are six times more likely to commit murder. The further implication is that, since we can't trust some blacks, we shouldn't trust any.

Words are powerful, and we have to be careful about how we use them. The issue isn't what you meant to say but how your message is perceived by others. As a reader, I'm trying to give you feedback on how your words came across to me and perhaps to others, too."
As sad as the events were in VA and the unfortunate loss of life. On the other hand in the perpetual Democrat Chicago eight people were killed over the weekend -not a peep in the fake news press. Only three of the eight deserved that fate. That three met their maker by invading the home of a lawfully armed citizen who was protecting his life and property. Guess none of those black lives mattered even to blacks.

"If I was sitting at a table with any black people present, and a person with the name or title ""Master"" was introduced, the same ironic thought that flashed into Marrus' head would go through mine as well. And it would occur to everyone else present also. Oh yes it would.

Marrus was however stupid enough to blurt it out in a clumsy attempt at humor.

The hypersensitivity shown by the reaction extends into the tech world by the way. In various communications protocols between electronic devices, the terms ""master"" and ""slave"" were used to accurately describe which device initiated a data transaction and which device responded.

But no more. Some little snowflakes were apparently outraged."

"Alas I can say that mural isn't at all representative of my experience with and what I've seen from most black people. Well, the cop part is; but that bit about a black guy sewing feathered peace into the world around him doesn't hold up well to all instances when I and others I've seen were scammed, robbed (once at gunpoint), conned, or threatened or beaten by black people.

I know there's decent ones out there; I've met three of them (yes, only three — but I'm not all that social). But, how many out of how many? Until I start meeting these doves this bit of propagandist art depicts I'm going to believe that most blacks in America have embraced an embittered self-segregating culture of macho violence. Like my idiot inbred Irish distant relatives do in places like West Virginia."

The black neighborhoods chicago and beyond are riddled with crime, drugs, gangs, prostitution, murder, blighted neighborhoods, domestic violence, no work and poor education. The number one cause of death of black men between the ages of 18 and 34 years is black on black HOMOCIDE!!!!!  How can they expect anyone to respect them when they in turn do not even respect each other. These millionaire football players are completely out of touch. If a police officer never killed another black person, there would not even be a little dent in their plight. The football players need to give back more than 60 seconds on their knees to their brothers. It will take generations of hard work, they need to be active in addressing the black problem"

"No George, the fact that the only people on death row are black men who killed fewer people than the white Aurora theater shooter (who is not on death row) is clear evidence that the death penalty process DOES NOT work. Apparently only white people can be ""insane"" in Colorado..."
No apologies. Trump is a bigot in the eyes of most people. He got his start in politics by claiming Obama was illegitimate and a Kenyan. People already know he hates Mexicans. He got caught and fined for discriminating against black people by refusing to let them rent property. And he did not blame the KKK in Charlottesville for killing and maiming people. Trump would like to whitewash the truth. But I consider him to be a bigot.

The First Amendment doesn't require that I tolerate your speech, only that the government cannot curtail it. But I can. No, Antifi and other protestors marching against neo Nazis and Klansmen are not ""just as bad"" as the Nazis and Klansmen. They are standing up to hate.

The fact that you like Ted Nugent saying Obama should suck on his machine gun means you're not really a serious person in civic debate. No, there was no ""Great War on any constitutional rights.

Sky high murder rates amongst themselves and a large percent more poverty. You speak as if this tactic is new.

White supremacy is so ingrained that we have Coloradans in 2017 defending the racist Confederacy when we weren't even a part of it. That's saying something.

Confederate soldiers were primarily poor white Southerners who fought on behalf of rich white slave owners for an unjust cause of tyranny and racism. White supremacy and divide and conquer have always been the methods to get poor white Americans to buy into racism when they had no real vested interest in it. Why do you want to celebrate poor whites getting drafted and conned to fight for unjust white supremacy and anti-black bigotry and tyranny?

Stop celebrating anti-black racism, divide and conquer strategy, and tyranny. Fulfill the ideals of Reconstruction, at long last."

"Exactly. Obama poured oil over troubled waters, calming people in the wake of what appeared to many to be a huge injustice - the stalking of an unarmed teen who was killed while attempting to save his own life from that armed stalker.

There's quite a contrast between the two presidents, Obama speaking to soothe tempers over a perceived injustice, Trump doubling down on his condemnation of those protesting violence against black citizens, calling them ""sons of b****es. Obama was recognized as a peacemaker, Trump earned the contempt of all decent people.

Obama didn't use the fact of black-on-black crime to justify the verdict, which was not that Trayvon was guilty - he wasn't on trial, he was dead, shot by a creepy self-appointed wanna-be cop; Obama pointed out that the jury found reasonable doubt that the armed creep committed intentional murder. It is you, motley, who is using a statement out of context to justify the killing of a black teen who was doing nothing illegal."

BTW, there are only an estimated 30,000 illegal workers in the entire farming community. A far cry from the 40+ million illegals that reside here and the jobs they stole from Americans.

The Democrats made this bed and they will be sleeping in it for a very long time.  Trump will be saving the country from going over the cliff with Obama Care....He could have waited for another couple of years until the Democrats were begging him to euthanize Obama Care but unlike his predecessor, he is showing himself to be a statesman and actually working for the benefit of our citizens instead of a historically failed ideology."
"LOL. What percentage of black Americans vote Republican? And why is that? Because Republicans can't stop putting their collective foot in their mouth and equating all black Americans with welfare and demonizing black Americans while pandering to the angry white base.

Maybe stop propagating the tired old propaganda of the helpless, feeble black American who is passively waiting for a welfare handout like Pavlov's dog waits for a treat. Because this is why the GOP can't earn the black vote. The modern GOP has no intention of trying to earn the black vote. They're still getting too much mileage demonizing and infantilizing black Americans in order to court the racist, white backlash vote. Southern Strategy. Thanks for the polite if condescending pat on the head, though, GOP, as you dismiss 38 million black Americans and sloppily paint all with one obscenely wide brush."

""African-American soldiers...were...prevented from going into any villages they passed...the African-American engineers...were given inferior construction equipment or no equipment at all...heavy equipment was delivered to less-experienced white regiments, leaving the black engineers to work with hand tools.""

They further need to go because the intent of putting them up during Jim Crow was to intimidate black citizens. Simply disgusting white nationalism, may it hit the scrap pile of history sooner rather than later."
"We can agree that violence was committed by both sides. And Trump denounced it.

But consider the motivations of the two groups. One wants a white America and for many decades has promoted hate and committed acts of violence against Catholics, Jews, immigrants, blacks, and all else who do not look or think like they do. 

The other side was composed of Americans who are deeply disgusted by white supremacy, and, yes, they fought fire with fire.

The SPLC also claims that its 101 anti-Muslim ""hate groups"" pose a threat, but nobody in the media seems to believe that the SPLC's 89 Muslim ""hate groups"" are even newsworthy. That's nearly a one-to-one ratio and yet no one is reporting on it because it doesn’t fit the narrative.

"Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that most predominately black countries are a violent mess, that blacks are involved in gangs and shootings all across the US and Canada, that our social housing projects are packed full with blacks who cannot afford to live in this country, and that many of them have difficulty in school. Other races tend to do better. The black community should be asking themselves what they can do to change how people perceive them."

I don't think it ridiculous to believe that families would be strong if parents were proper parents. Neither is it ridiculous to think schools would have an easier time doing their job if they didn't have to contend with behavioral issues among their children.  What I was trying to get at was a stance I often encounter,  that upon considering these truisms, Black people are properly understood to be responsible for the wretchedness of so many of their schools, for the uncongenial aspects of their neighborhoods, the vexations they experience around employment, the disparities in policing,

"There are a lot of arms out there held by  many categories of society or groups, such as gangs of illegal aliens, or the urban blacks that commit crimes against whites and their own people. 

The point is that ""White Supremacy"" as a movement commands the hearts and mind of a very small , insignificant segment of the population. This movement, if one can even describe it as such is a small, poorly organized, statistically insignificant social phenomenon. Just because a certain number of White Supremacists happen to be violent idiots, rather than just idiots does not increase this faltering movement's significance. The mass media is making the movement appear significant as does the Bishop's unwarranted response.

Remember the infallible Pope who declared that the crossbow, the world's most lethal weapon at the time, could not be used against Christians but only against Muslims because they were inferior both morally and religiously. Remember the Pope who declared that  native South Americans were animals and so they could be slaughtered in order that the Spanish and Portuguese could steal their lands. Remember the Pope who declared that black Africans had no souls and so they could be used as slaves in the colonies to benefit the wealth of the Jesuit sugar plantations! Get educated about infallibility!"
"All Jason Domingo said is that ha'olies (literally 'foreigners', usually referring to white people) act this way in Hawaii as well.  Everything from Captain Cook's arrival there to the current one-sided ""power relationships"" between ha'ole and native Hawaiian SUBSTANTIATE his comment.  It was NOT ""uncivil"" for him to tell the TRUTH.

And here's the double-standard at the root of such hypocrisy (five'll getcha ten this will get voted into the ""uncivil zone"", as well.  I'll just re-post it.):

When Ted Bundy, James Holmes, Dylan Storm Roof and their ilk commit crimes, white folks say they're ""crazy"" or ""troubled.""  When black or brown folks commit crimes, white folks attribute it to ""cultural"" or ""moral"" deficiencies in those entire groups.  Don't bother with the ""disproportionate"" arguments to rationalize this double-standard, unless you're willing to discuss the fact that child-molesters and mass-shooters are disproportionately white.

"I have the distinct advantage of being white (and by that I mean very N. European) and my wife is from the Caribbean (being a mix of African, European and whatever).  For the better part of our careers we have both worked in the high tech sector, even at the same company for a while.  Seeing as many people did not realize the relationship between my wife and myself, they would say things in my presence which revealed their true nature and often that nature, especially towards black professionals, was simply wretched.  In the modern workplace visible, religious, and ethnic minorities are well represented but most people have come to accept that people from those non-white groups have a long history of achieving their professional credentials.  For black people though, far too many people still believe that they should be subservient and just happy to have a good job, and heaven forbid that a black person say something more intelligent than anyone else or challenge a non-black colleague."

Most of my enemies that have tried to kill me are white Americans. All I want is equal rights under the law. Unfortunately, most white folks don't think that is an issue.

And an artist is not compelled to make art for just anyone.  I am not saying that he is an artist (you really like to say things that I haven't said), I am saying that he has a decent case and it's not a slam dunk, as so many asset, that he loses.  And you seem to be confusing selling art with creating commissioned art. As I said earlier, if they came in to buy say a piece of cake, he would have to sell it to them.  However they commissioned a cake to be made and he refused.  Why would black people be discriminated on religious basis?   Black people tend to be very religious.

"From this letter:

Is it fine for an Hispanic woman to make racist comments about white women? 

 Is it fine for woman Hispanics to make racist comments about Black, Asian, Muslim, or any other 'race' of women just because they are Hispanic speakers?

When you answer those two questions, I will then know your values regarding 'racist speech'.

I answer both of those questions totally and unequivocally ""NO!"""

These players are a joke . The very fact they have high paying jobs just to play a game shows America is a country that gives everyone a chance to be the best they can be and is a country to be proud of .  Since they have the right to take a knee---does that mean I have the right to use the N word any time I want ?  I'd never do that since it would be disrespectful to them---just as they are being disrespectful of the very country that puts the food on they're table .   The NFL has clear cut rules that tells the players they must stand while they are on the job . The second they enter the arena they are on the clock . Why doesn't the NFL enforce it's own clear cut rules ?   I'm one of those who will change the channel when games come on until these over paid players stop disrespecting America .

"I don't see how you can fault the sentence for being misleading. I mean, it says right there that he was black, male, and young.  That alone is evidence of a clear and present danger. And that a police officer shot him proves it. Any right-thinking person would automatically know that Brown was far from innocent. There is no need to repeat his sordid particulars. I really can't see any inaccuracy here. 

Properly, all the dangerous young Black men I know get rousted by police officers. So far, they have been able to curb their violent natures enough to spare the officers the necessity of shooting them. At 14, D.J.  can choke down his foolish angst at being thrown against a car, cuffed and sat on a curb, while the milk he was sent to purchase turns sour. But the wanton criminality bred into him could show itself eventually.  One day, it may even surface as an ill-conceived expression of indignation.

"One concept I came across a few years ago was  the term ""white privilege"". What surprised me was the response from the ""whites"" when confronted with this term; "" ...  this was an affront to our race. ... "" "" ... we are just as poor and marginalised as thosed ""coloured"" people. ... "".

To me it was obvious they did not understand what the term meant.

Thinking about the the recent US elections, I would like to suggest that white privilege played a significant role in the voting pattern of primarily white males. An irrational fear had been generated that the tide was against them. The gratuitous statement of making America great ""again"" emphased their fear that they have been ""left behind"".

They  just had eight years of a black man as president and now the posibilty of a woman, although ""white"" and who was much maligned as one of those ""elites"", would continue to perpetuate their slide from being one of the privileged class for at least another four years."

Especially, one who have not expressed once, a concern for the black people’s suffering of violent discriminations even though many posters revealed documented facts of disproportional severe sentences for the black men by CJS. 
And turn around insisting that one is not racially prejudice by not saying ‘white’ police?
Saying ‘white’ police is a compliment since ‘white’ imply ‘superiority’ not like ‘black’ which imply ‘inferiority’ per current custom in the US.

"Of course we do not require doctors to perform abortions against their will. That has nothing to do with this.

To use your analogy we'd have to be talking about an abortion doctor who refused their services to Hindus. 

This is a civil rights issue. In the same way that you cannot put up a sign in your store that says ""no blacks"" you are not allowed to discriminate based on who someone is. You have every right to discriminate based on what someone does however (no shoes no shirt no service). Because this baker had a business open to the public, but refused his services because they were gay, he violated their civil rights. 

He actually has done the right thing by refusing to offer cakes at all. If he can't stomach the idea that his services would be used by the public, of which some citizens might be gay, then he should not make cakes. Same thing for racist doctors: if you offer right to die services but don't like the idea of serving black people then you shouldn't offer it at all."
"Agreed, but why do you want police to perpetuate a retribution towards a group that is already upset at police?

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot. It doesn't look like Nick Zukin is that kind of business owner. I suppose some people just like to commit business-suicide.

"The, ongoing, collective, failure of Blacks, in America, to achieve economic equity, with Whites,  can be traced to certain characteristics that are inherent to that race.
First, it in a fact of life, that blacks, on average, have significantly, lower IQs than Whites. Then the problems associated with  low average IQ of Blacks, is compounded by their collective  tendency to drop out of school early, & to be disruptive to the learning environment, while in school.  Then add to this, the common use of foul language, & their manner of dress, with their pants down below their butts, & their tendency towards violent crime Blacks, by their behavior & poor attitudes, are the cause of their, generally low level of achievement in America.

Point being, that the races are not equal,"

I don't think your characterization of the US is factually correct, though it depends on how one defines freedom and ""true"" equality. US history has been defined by tension and conflict between its ideals (as enshrined in the Bill of Rights), versus our failure to live up to those ideals (e.g., slavery; women's exclusion from voting; etc.). 

But in any case, the freedom to protest inequality is much more important - and in keeping with liberal democratic ideals - than flag fetishism."

"Yes, that was a racist comment, and its author is an embarrassment to whatever creed he professes.

That said, note that there is racism on both sides.  Consider Black Lives Matter.   BLM teaches that Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.  BLM is committed to disrupting the nuclear family structure, advocating Black “villages” where they support each other as extended families.  BLM is also committed to dismantling so-called “cis-gender privilege.”  They are working to rebuild the Black liberation movement, based on the idea that virulent anti-Black racism permeates our society.  They teach that the imprisonment of black people state violence.  You be the judge."

You should never change your behavior because of another persons skin color... NO MATTER WHAT COLOR IS IN CHARGE!"
"""Lopera, who is white, and Brown, who is black, then wrestle as the officer attempts to handcuff him. Lopera punches Brown’s head and neck from behind as Venetian security guards join the effort and other police officers arriving.

Sheriff Joe Lombardo told The Associated Press there was no indication that race played a role in the incident.""

But you can't very well stoke the fires if you DON'T bring it up, right?"
"The worst thing is that the supposed ""patriots"" like trump and those so incensed by seeing black players silently and peacefully protesting racial injustice during the anthem that they are claiming to boycott the NFL, had no thoughts of boycotting the NFL because of players who commit violence against women. 

Jerry Jones threatens to bench his players if they don;t stand for the anthem but he had no problem hiring and playing Greg Hardy the wife beater. And he fought hard to prevent the NFL from suspending Elliot the girlfriend beater (though yay! he lost).

I didn't hear any calls for boycotts when Jamis the rapist, came into the league. How long did Sebastien Rapeykowski play without a peep from fans? How about Big Ben Rapistburger accused twice and bought his way out with settlements. No boycotts for him. 

Seems like a poignant commentary on our nation. Violence against women? Meh. Black men protesting? How dare they!"
"I'm not happy about my tax dollars paying for unnecessary wars that don't make us safer and create more terrorists that hate us, and state sponsored murder of unarmed people by our public employee police. The white cop that murdered the black 12 year old in Cleveland was fired for lying on his application, not murder. You would think that you have to pass a background check to be a cop. Every month there is some variation of this story in the USA. I guess you think your comfort with Americans dying for no reason other than greed, trumps my concern for the living, including children. I don't doubt that Trump shares your values. I take you guys at your words.  Many of you think you are victims. Sadly, you can't follow the money. You think the poor and minorities get more free stuff from the government than the 1%. You don't know what lobbyists do for their 6 figure incomes. Thanks for proving my point. BTW, most of the terrorists in the USA have been white Americans."
"For all those who claim that kneeling is disrespect to flag and country are dead wrong, period. The only disrespect is unarmed people are being killed by those sworn to protect. Since we are referring to Black Americans in these instances, I would have you know that Black Americans fought in every war America has waged. This is fact and here's the first......In 1770, Crispus Attucks, a black man, became the first casualty of the American Revolution when he was shot and killed in what became known as the Boston Massacre. This in a time where Mr. Attucks could not even be counted as a citizen. Look in the mirror and repeat after me, ..... I'm not allowed to be a citizen, but I can die for your tea? The ultimate disrespect!"
"What a bunch of Bolshevik dezenformatzia that was.  The Georgetown professor states, ""people think black people are violent and dangerous.""
Professor, without having  to drag out all the uniform crime statistics again, people don't just think that, they know that.
But then, he's a college professor."
"More to the point, when did YOU? That is, when did you interview all 1.6 billion Muslims, as you demanded of me? When was the last time you had a run in with a gun toting domestic Muslim terrorist? YOU are the bigot, not I. But in fact I have been held up at gunpoint twice, both times by white males in the US. Never by a Muslim, never by a black person or a Hispanic."
I can understand the 10 whites on the jury acquitting the officer.  Racists will be racists.  But it's harder to understand the two blacks on the jury acquiescing to this travesty.  Who were the two black jurors?  Clarence Thomas and Ben Carson?
"Drake is half black. Being a Jew is not a race its a set of ideas like other religions.
Ivanka Trump is Jewish because she converted nothing to do with this talk about race and other nonsense."
"If there can be a zillion movements supposedly fighting for black civil rights, then why can there not be a movement for whites or Afrikaners? Why is it then criticized or demonized?

There is everything from Black Lawyers to Black Business to Black Gunowner societies. Yet nothing is ever said about them.

But the (white) liberal media and mostly Media24's Basson and Du Preez constantly attack Afriforum and constantly say they are supposedly fighting for ""white privilege"".

I am so sick of this. Why can white people not have an organization to protect their rights? As a minority these rights are blatantly trampled on by politicians and media on a daily basis.

If it was not for Afriforum, the pandemic of farm murders would not even be in the spotlight. The government ignores it and refuses to act. There are an average of 2 farm murders every single week. Yet the media barely bothers to report on it. It sickens me that those who raise a serious problem are the ones who are demonized."
So what your data is saying is that minorities commit a disproportionate amount of crime. 22% of murder suspects were black while they represent only 5.9% of the population. You're being intellectually dishonest in an effort to appear not racist.
"Why would a Korean be offended if a Chinese person dress like a war-torn Korean?  Why would a Jewish person be offended by a German dressing like a stereotypical Jew?  Why would a Native American be offended by a white American mocking their misfortune at the hands of their oppressor?  Why would a black person, with African roots, whose ancestors were enslaved and  killed feel good about being mocked in what some called a cinematic work of art: The Birth of a Nation.   A movie that featured white actors in black-face, who were portrayed as murderers and heathens before the Klan saved the day.   The reason, in most instances, is that most of us are not informed or just ignorant.  So, why don't we make this personal...Think of the worst thing someone could do to a family member, and then imagine them showing up next Halloween at your doorstep wearing your family members likeness."
"@jacques 633 - your response is unintelligible gobbledygook. She is guilty for taking on this bully - spoken like a real man! (not) This was a racist and misogynistic incident but lets focus on one thing at a time - this"" brave"" white man manhandled the black child, that is assault and child abuse - he should be in goal, just on that."
"If the nurse was black this country would be in flames by now.  In any event, the officer will be punished."
"Agirl:  I presume you read the story and watched the video of the Black gentleman being beaten by white supremacists/white nationalists in the parking structure in Charlettesville.  I believe that just might qualify as violence and, in fact, a hate crime.  The story, witness testimony and the video are all specific evidence.  ""get your facts straight or keep quiet...the world has enough useful idiots already"".....I work very hard to be sure any facts I present are accurate.  It helps avoid ad hominem attacks for individuals who disagree with my OPINIONS.  However, as your post shows, it doesn't always work.  Gary Crum"
Daily Maverick has no shame. Any black person who accuses the black nation of being corrupt is your white knight. Your paper has never written anything positive about the ANC government. Why don't you emigrate to Zimbabwe or North Korea or China?
"Most who are in any situation where any sort of punishment or disciplinary actions are used (e.g. schools or the military) agree that there is a racial disparity - black and Latinos are punished less harshly than their white or Asian counterparts.  No wants the paperwork unless they have to.  Unfortunately, Little Jamekiel has been told by his parent from birth that he doesn't need to listen to The Man, who is just trying to keep him down.  So he has no manners or idea how to behave in a group setting and ends up getting in trouble repeatedly."
"I get it. You HAD to vote for a man who was busted for committing illegal housing discrimination against black Americans. Your commitment to ""freedom and liberty"" commanded you.  You had to vote for a man who barged into the dressing room at the Miss Teen USA pageant to ogle UNDERAGE girls. Your commitment to ""family values"" commanded you. You had to vote for the 6 time bankrupt billionaire who repeatedly stiffed his creditors and the subcontractors who were stupid enough to trust him. Because your ""fiscal responsibility"" commanded you. You had to vote for a guy who does all his manufacturing overseas while paying lip service to ""America First"". Your economic ""patriotism"" commanded you.  Pfffft. 

There were 22 presidential candidates on Colorado's 2016 ballot. You could have chosen 20 other candidates besides Trump or Clinton. Don't deflect to Clinton. If you voted for Trump, you own it. I don't ever want to hear about ""values"" from you on this board. With all due respect."
So they replace a man who wanted the south to keep blacks as slaves with a man whose political party depends on keeping blacks enslaved. Makes sense.
"In crusading against what he perceives to be social injustice at the University, Michael ignores a far greater injustice... the recent rash of U of O black athletes sexually assaulting women.

A woman was raped in October 2015 by Brandon Austin, a woman assaulted last August by Torrodney Prevot, and a woman punched in the face at Taylor's by 250 pound Eddie Heard. Were these women white? Are there racial undertones in these assaults?

There was no front page coverage of these assaults in the RG and it's hard to find names of the victims, pictures, or reports on their trauma. Is this apparent ""blackout"" to protect victims or their attackers?

Where's the outrage at the U of O regarding what appears to be this trend of black male athletes sexually assaulting women? What if they were white athletes assaulting black women?

University of Oregon's and Michael's concerns over a white woman wearing a black face that physically harmed no one appears both prejudiced and hypocritical."
What makes Trudeau Butts happy is giving away 10 million to terrorists and watching black clad anonymous leftist thugs beating Canadian senior citizens bloody on CBC TV.
"Disagreeing with Elvi Gray-Jackson does not make you a ""racist"".  When I first saw her comments in the ADN I didn't agree with her and I have clue or care what race she was.  When I first saw her picture my first thought wasn't that she was black, it was that she looked like the Joker."
"No, friend. I believe you're less situationally-aware than I am. Less cognizant of the grim spectre we all face, in varying degrees, whether you are rich or poor, white or black, cisgender or transgender, sociopathic or empathic, politically deluded or cognizant. Not knowing just makes you another passenger on a ship of fools bound for their destination and destiny of despair."
by the way. I phrased that question wrong. .what did he do for blacks?  what the hail did he do for mississippi?  this is where I live..and if I'm not mistaken he never sat a foot here in 8 dam years.  I don't even remember him coming here when he campaigned the first time. some blacks are soooooooooooooooo.....  never mind
"Please. Open your eyes if you think senior management in ANY Canadian industry is diverse.  This woman's experience is true, there is a fundamental lack of diversity within senior executive positions FULL. STOP. Canada is such an old-boys (men)-club, and I would even go so far as to say AMERICA is better at diversity in finance/law/senior upper management than Canada, which is TRULY SAD. 

All those commenting that she's 'complaining' or 'victim-blaming' I tell you wake the f*** up.  As a black woman born and raised in Toronto who went to private school in completely white spaces, and whose fully upper-middle class and is well-versed with whiteness what she described is completely true. It's the constant assumption you don't belong or that you're poor/not as smart that is pervasive and infuriating.

Thank you Hadiya for tell this story."
"I agree - Obama was no more than a dream, a sick fantasy that implied that an unskilled, untried black man could actually do something good for the country (not just make people feel good for electing a black person) and he failed totally.

Now we have switched trains and so far, the track is looking clear and we are moving forward. If the hypocrites would sober up, accept their defeat and quit attacking everything he does they would likely find out we are on a far better path - obviously they are afraid of that..

You speak of 'paranoid' - you are labeling the left IN MASS!"
"The only racism I've been seeing is baseless accusations and chips on the shoulders of black transplants obviously uncomfortable in a town full of white people and probably wondering why so few of us want to pal around with them. It's a cultural thing, really; I just don't dig it, same as I didn't dig the crusty old mutant conservative villagers in Switzerland when I lived there. Same as you probably wouldn't dig the company of Amish farmers.

The native Portland white is for the most part a mellow guy who doesn't like confrontation or violence and feels uncomfortable, even disgusted, by garish displays of macho posturing. Knowing that what we regard as civility is considered “pussy” by African Americans who come here with Big Bad Cali/East Coast attitudes simply adds insult to injury. Maybe if you'd holster your iron and let us get to know you and not the strutting rooster you'd be pleasantly surprised at how accepting we are."
"have you not been witnessing this election cycle? 
what are these ""values and morals"" you speak of?

did the erosion of ""values and morals"" begin when black citizens were allowed to vote, or was it when we let women vote?

guess what BB, you know many people that use cannabis, you just don't know it! 
good Americans who get up every morning and go to work and are productive members of society. they pay their taxes they buy Coca Cola and Chevrolets and they enjoy baseball. 

AND THEY VOTE!     
so, welcome to America BB, land of the free home of the brave. 
what you are witnessing is pure and simple AMERICAN. 

how the F do people like you fail to see that?

why do i have a sneaking suspicion you felt the same way about that whole ""civil rights"" BS in the mid sixties?

i sure enjoy those memes that say: when a republican doesn't like guns, he doesn't buy a gun...  why don't republicans that don't smoke weed just, i don't know, don't smoke weed? were is the disconnect?"
"Are you telling us that white Southern Baptists routinely went to church with MLK, or black people in general? I was born at night, but not last night. Sunday morning is the most segregated time of the week in this country. White bigots can rationalize all kinds of violent behavior. They never take responsibility for their actions. I have never heard a white racist admit to be a white racist. They just know those none white people are just not as good as white folks."
Sessions misses the good old days when any white man could murder any black person and be sure no white jury would convict them of murder. That is how the white lynchers of Emmitt Till  benefited from jury nullification by an all white jury. I guess they will make it federal law that no black people can be on a jury judging white people. That goes double if the white criminals were abusing black folks. I have no reason to believe different about this KKK sympathizer. I'm sure Trump voters won't mind.
"What  a strange passive aggressive argument.  Here's a thought: Stop killing Black people.    It is sad and ironic to see the many instances where armed White men are threatening law enforcement and waiving firearms, but the officers don't panic and don't shoot.  If a person is Black, deadly force is generally the first option employed.  Any White person who does not see this as a problem is hopelessly out of touch, and all the words in the world cannot change your POV.  Enjoy your White Privilege."
"Nice straightforward statement by Brown! The black power salute means ""F*** whitey"" so none of his white teammates need to support him or link arms with him. There is no unity being sought here, and no PC sugar coating is needed,  like the NFL tried to do with Kaepernick.  This guy raised his fist, it's his business and let him live with it. Don't pretend he's ""starting a dialogue"" or contributing to society, just move on."
"Obama did the same thing, taking a blind eye when the Black  Gorillas( re-branded Black Panthers),  patroled and stood guard at polling booths in the south , or failed to make comments about Black Lives Matter movent calling for ""pigs in the blanket call"". Yeah, blame Trump and his support base, but it started before him. Obama did the same thing. White people see an opportunity to get even and most us didn't care enough to vote. Couple that with police afraid of over-reacting (Post Ferguson policing), expect more events like this. I think Chicago is ready to explode, blacks moving violence out of the housing areas into the city,  their way of getting even."
"But Paulie, you once said that the nomination of Trump could be a sign of End Times. 

""Donald John Trump, a billionaire bigmouth, a carny barker with delusions of grandeur, a narcissist whose campaign success is fueled by the fury seething in this country. In a nation of 330 million souls, that Trump could be considered seriously for president, much less nominated by a major party, could be a sign of the End Times. No, really.""

""Trump, with his runaway yap and startlingly tempestuous idiocy…""

""His supporters, like Sarah Palin's, are disinterested in facts. Their minds are made up.""

""During a campaign speech in a very white Michigan suburb, Trump fished for African-American votes by asking, ""What the hell do you have to lose?"" We as a nation are about to find out.""

My, my, how quickly we forget. But don't worry, I'll keep reminding you and your readers, every week if necessary."
"If she wasn't a black woman she would have been fired.

It's up to you to decide if that's the soft bigotry of low expectations."
"Disproportionately:

Blacks committed about 55% of the murders, despite making up only 13% of the population.  Disproportionately.

Blacks were responsible 88% of the time, when another black person was murdered, despite making up only 13% of the population.  Disproportionately.

30% of all criminal arrests are of blacks, despite making up only 13% of the population. Disproportionately.

40% of the time that a police officer is murdered, it is by a black male, despite making up only 7% of the population.  Disproportionately.
Source: FBI Expanded Homicide Tables #3 and 6, and others.

Correlation is not causation.  Being black does not cause you to commit crimes.

However, if you are DISPROPORTIONATELY involved in a higher number of police ""criminal interactions/interdictions"", you might get shot at a DISPROPORTIONATELY higher rate (26%).

I know.  Big Numbers.  They mean things."
"Admit it... He is a black President and his skin color sends racists with pea sized brains into a frothing lather at the thought of him being more statesmanlike, more intelligent, more eloquent, and is for the American people, in contrast to the white pea brained, shoot from the hip, frothing at the mouth let's invade them,  what's in it for me and my corporate masters Republicans, Bush and Trump.
Skin color"
"I knew the NFL would cave in, after making a big show of their so-called respect for player’s Personal expression.  Nothing is more political than the NFL, in a conservative direction of course.  Now we see what a charade their principled stance was, as they threaten the players with job loss if they refuse to accept the NFL’s empty definition of patriotism.  Don’t these black men know that their jobs are to put their bodies on the line for our entertainment, and to keep their mouths shut about the brutalizations that regularly occurs in their communities at the hands of police?"
"Which White Supremacists and Anti government idealists are these?  Please name all the terrorist acts that they have recently committed.  What is your basis to say that since 9-11 they are far more likely to kill US citizens?  What about the black guy that killed 5 cops in Dallas?  That is ok, he is justified because he is not a White Supremacist?  The night club shooting in Florida was a jihadist attack on US soil.  There is increasing attacks and deaths in Europe due to Jihadists and it is getting worse.  It is only a matter of time before there is another major incident in the USA.  The fact is radical Islam from these 7 countries is a huge threat no matter what you say."
"I am religious and if the baker did what he did based on Christianity then his position is hypocritical at best. Id be willing to bet he has never turned away a heterosexual couple who had sex before their wedding day in his entire career. Where this case gets sticky is...does the government have a right to make you be a part of something you don't believe matches up with your moral code. People have typed a lot of words but nobody has shown me anything that would prevent a Jewish Baker from having to do business with a Nazi sympathizer or a Black baker from doing Business with someone who really loves the KKK. 
The Little Guy"
"Indulging in political masturbation and fancy irrelevant historical facts and manufacturing ghost enemies while ignoring the insult, disrespect and contempt with which the Guptas have treated the South African citizens. Just remember that by your silence you have betrayed us. You and your ilk have made some black South Africans to start talking about apartheid in nostalgic terms. Yes, it is true. Get on the trains, the taxis and the buses and you will hear ordinary South Africans lamenting alk the sacrifices they made to put you in government."
Pot calling the skillet black you are....
"Kimaren, your bias/prejudice is blatantly obvious !  But, then, its part of the mindset.  We blame Blacks for their mentality of playing the victim, demanding everything for free, venality etc. , but its like not seeing the beam in your own eye."
"Defense spending is enumerated responsibility of the federal government, running our lives, or even our health care is not.
If you believe that the federal government should control our health care, work to amend the constitution.

"LBJ was a democrat and certainly not a ""liberal"" by today's standards. So you have respect for the majority? How about little fingers donnie's numbers? 60+% think he's an ignorant buffoon and will only drive this country into the dirt. White people are certainly not innocent of rampant racism that is now systemic and some white folks just can't see it or don't want to. BTW, black folks aren't the only ones who riot over rampant injustice."
"I wonder what old white guys think is worse, having a black president or woman president.  Up here in the chow halls it's been 7 plus years of its obamas fault that they are all neutered toothless hillbillies.  It will be interesting to see and hear how they cry if a woman is elected president.  A curious phenomenon occurs every time a black man walks in the chow hall, the loud crying about Obama stops.  All loud and proud as long as no minorities are around."
Maybe the dear black people show would be about black men explaining why they don't have any interest in supporting or raising their children. Or why they don't value education.
"I understand. The nazis are being exposed once and for all. We are seeing who is for equality for all citizens and who are the white supremacists who post comments with trash like, ""how about a black state? Would this make the black race happy?""

Perish the thought that you would view black Americans as equal citizens, dude. It's  been 400 years. Isn't it about time you gave up your divisive anti-black bigotry and your white supremacy?"
"Charles Wohlforth why don't you apply for a job at the Huffington Post.  They run a continuing Trump slam site for Hillary.  I think you would fit right in.  You don't have to be so negative, you know.  Trump hasn't a chance.  His move to the policy of protecting the interests of native-born or established inhabitants against those of immigrants has trumped his political ambition.  The Blacks and Hispanics are voting in mass for Hillary.  So unless the White race votes in mass for Trump it is very unlikely he can win.  This election is all about race for the Blacks and Hispanics.  So unless the Whites are as racist as the Blacks and Hispanics Trump is doomed.  I don't think Whites are racist enough to elect Trump."
"Trump was a lifelong Democrat so that would meet one qualification for a racist.  Democrats are the Party of Slavery and Jim Crow Laws which gave us legalized second-class citizens. The KKK was formed by former white supremacist military officers defeated by Lincoln's army.  They were all Democrats who hated the Republican President.  Their nice statues are being pulled down by other Democrats.  
American Nazis hate just about everyone; Jews, Blacks, Catholics, Mexicans... and more.  I won't put those morons on the Democrats even though Democrats put them on Republicans everyday."
"lies, damn lies, and statistics. Now factor in black on black crime, and your position sinks like a lead weight, doesn't hold water.
 For example; lets put this on illegal employment. The majority are brown folks from south of the border, and so they are 10 times more likely to be talking to the fuzz though white folks seriously outnumber them."
"Are you a Patriot ?
I  believe President Trump loves America, more passionately than President Obama.
I don't understand why you always pull the race card, your reactions are exactly the type of generic  response most white people want to achieve, especially the supremacists.
You can blame poor white folks for electing Trump if you like, but if Hillary was elected or Bernie would you be proclaiming that poor black folks from the inner cities elected them ? I don't think so, instead you would probably attack someone for making a comment similar to yours.
Black racists are just as real as White racists, both speak in undertones of disgust, heck, I've even met a fair share of Hispanic  racists. There is no point in highlighting race and pointing fingers anymore, people who are ill-willed always will be that way. 
Making America Great Again has nothing to do with white people having inbred children and overrunning your way of life, if you're worried about white racists buy more bullets."
Yeah....we wouldn't want you to have to listen to any black people that might tell a reality that disrupts your worldview.
"No surprise, black lives matter protesters chant kill police, and black lives matter terrorists kill police."
BLM is a racist organization that promotes violence against police officers and anyone who isn't black and doesn't fall in line with their hate filled agenda.
"You are more disgusting to say that the black men who were shot under such sketchy circumstances were all violent black offenders. Too many of black teens and men ""death by cops"" were in cases they were stopped for no reason, were not armed and some shot in the back."
"IF BLM were as concerned about black on black murder, none of this would be an issue."
"White males can't compete with black males when it comes to violent crime in America. Not even close. Haven't seen any numbers regarding black pedophiles, but you are probably correct on that particular observation regarding white males."
"They put him in handcuffs and placed him in the vehicle, just like they have done with every other suspect for years and years, and this idiot thought it would be a good idea to lurch around in the back of a moving vehicle to get an injury.  Some times when you mess with the bull, you get the horns.  He got the horns.  I know, lets try to fry 6 cops who did their jobs (did anyone notice that 3 out of 6 were BLACK?)  BCLATOTTM!!!!  (Black criminal lives are the only thing that matters)"
"Steven, where are the BLM protests on black on black crime?

There are none -- they only protest when police have to take the lives of black criminals.

You're not winning any arguments by simply crying ""racist."""
"Obviously not, if you think that the only reason that some black people fail in life is because I'm white and not their poor life choices."
"Yeah, now you can ""recover"" from ""the likes"" of a
black president and save yourself from the affront of a female in such a leadership position."
"last time with QUAIA (Queers Against Israeli Apartheid) marching in the Parade and playing politics

the funding is for gay rights and gay pride politics
and not for politics like Black activism, anti-Israel activism
cut the funding and stop the nonsense already

"Sorry, Paul--as usual can't take you seriously.  First, you act as if LEO's getting round to tabulating their kills for the first time just last YEAR was something to be proud of.  White cops have been murdering black folks since back when they weren't afraid to be photographed at lynchings.

Fact is the FBI admits the stats are woefully incomplete because a significant number of LEO's simply refuse to keep count of their kills.  Could be why I've seen three different counts and breakdowns, including yours, for 2015 in just the past two days.

The one I really like is how cops somehow don't KNOW the 'race' of about one in five of their victims.  Did they explode when they were shot?  Catch fire?  Disintegrate?  Melt?  If forensic pathologists and anthropologists can usually determine the 'races' of centuries-old corpses, one would think this should be possible in the immediate aftermath of a police shooting.

Don't insult our intelligence, Paul--put a little more effort into your lies."
"Maybe signs - ""No blacks allowed"", ""We dont serve Indians"". Oregon's alt left has ridden a time machine back to the 1940's and adopted that era's philosophy wholesale - socialism and the KKK."
"This article is unbelievable.  This is pure garbage.  Change KKK and Nazi to The new Black Panthers and this article would be trash about Obama. You are so wrong. Because one wants to enforce the present immigration law does not make one a racist.  This article is a perfect example of why he got elected.  People are tired of this arrogant, condescending, liberal elitist attitude.  Keep writing this drivel and  your group of like thinkers will continue to shrink, which by the way would be better for the country. We are fed up with people who think they are better than us and know what is good for us.  We are rebelling and it will continue. We show our maturity and disgust not by rioting in the street, lame protesting or holier that thou written articles.  We vote and convince people of a better path. Your ilk is losing. Democrats have lost at least 1200 elected positions  across the country since 2009.  And this will continue. Keep these attitudes and you guarantee 65 Rep. Sen. in 2112."
"Yeah actually it did make it right. Marxists slipped in and opened the floodgates to hell.

90% of crime is done by blacks and immigrants."
of COURSE that was your clear observation eric.....that's who you are.  All while ignoring your own intolerant hatred that you spew here daily. Just toss out the black president line to call all your enemies racists and anything else is completely excused
"""It did not impact the all-white jury, which found Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam innocent of Till’s murder. Both men later admitted in a national publication to killing Till because they found the young boy’s self-confidence and refusal to adopt racial deference threatening to their strong belief in white supremacy.""

That's why white racists demanded to see Barack Obama's birth certificate.  A superbly educated African-American president threatened their belief in white superiority.  The tragedy is that the leader of the white racists was elected after Obama."
"Our media's handling of racial issues is so bizarre.

A black man shot up a white church last week, and that barely made a blip in the news. 

Someone scribbled racist graffiti anonymously, and it's nationwide news.

Whites are victimized at a much higher rate by blacks than blacks are whites, yet there's this pervasive and dishonest narrative that blacks are somehow under attack by racist white lynch mobs.

The data doesn't support that, the facts don't support that. Why does the media support that?"
"What are you talking about?  White and black people commit WAY MORE terrorism in the west than islam does

The stats are easily verified dude"
"Little Johnny was never too bright, He even thought the program to ensure that everyone could buy insurance was itself the insurance, The confusion really set in when little Johnny went to write a check for his premium and discovered that he wasn't writing the check to the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare but to some private for profit insurance company who is sticking it to their customers because their Republican employees in the Congress of the United States made damn sure they could, Because you see they didn't like the Black guy in the White house and would shoot their own mothers on Mothers Day just to blame it on the Black Guy."
"Alan might be learned, but he sounds like a damn fool. Is he questioning the judicial system? What about grand juries adjudicating Blacks where the makeup is likely to be mostly White? C'mon man! Keep it real OK"
"You do realize that white folks brought black folks here to do jobs white folks didn't want to do. Trump does not care about poor people of any race. Why not give the black man a job no white man Trump trusts, wants. We know Trump does not care about the housing for poor people. That would be counter to his nature."
"But that's the thing - nothing really changes. Democrat out, Republican in. Garbage in, garbage out. The government will not repair things for you. It will just screw them up in different ways. But hey, as long as you get to stick it to the black guy and it feels good, I guess that's what's important, right? No time to solve big problems when we have petty grudges to pay back."
"""Marble went on to tell the Scouts that she’s from a multi-ethnic background that includes “black, Mexican…Jew…Native American” and the “lousy Irish!” People in the audience chuckled.""

Don't know which is worse - ""Jew"" and ""Dirty Irish"" - or the fact that some people ""chuckled"".
This woman has clearly lost her Marbles."
"Boots said: “The reason why I said white boys is that whites were the largest group of Donald's supporters. Even white women voted for him. Do you deny this?”

Stop. Just stop. The only thing worse than a racist is a racist who starts trying to be “reasonable” and explain “all I meant was... but it’s true....” I’ve heard it a million times. 

“Just curious but did you complain when people said Obama on got in only because all of the blacks voted for him just because he was black? Maybe you did.”

Yes I did. Every time. 

This conversation is over."
"It's ""Boipatong"" and ""apologize."" But be that as it may, another fine piece of manufactured leftard outrage. But I do have a solution for you: given that you are practically insanely outraged over apartheid (also just 1 p), why don't you sell all your assets and hand over the proceeds to black people, to show us how really, truly,  f...king sorry you are (wth apologies to Monty Python?) This includes, of course, the PC on which you so regularly spew your brain-dead bilge. That way, not only will some apartheid victims benefit, but we will all also be spared from having to read your nonsensical whingeing."
"You are paranoid, Media focuses on his blackness (race) articles from National Post focus on Jewish donors not happy with Obama regarding UN resolution on Israel.
Jewish donors very angry in the Chicago area. Therefore complain about media giving attention to his racial make up and also take it up with NP and Chicago donors complaining."
"She should be fired.. But she's a liberal, black female, and works for ESPN... Robert E. Lee, the Chinese game announcer, was pulled off the game because of his name... ESPN has become a racist network..."
"Yes, white racists are stupid, deluded, and loathsome. Nonetheless,  a little historical perspective would be good here. Yes, the Papacy licensed the conquest of non-Christian lands in 1493 (actually, much earlier), just as the conquest and subjugation of non-Islamic lands, including India, and the death or enslavement of those who resisted,  had been licensed for Muslims.  The Spanish/Portuguese didn't seek to exterminate aboriginals under Papal license, but to subjugate, exploit, and enslave them. Their model was the Reconquista, itself modelled on the Muslim conquest of Spain, but disease foiled their plans for exploitation. 12.5 million black slaves, mostly males bought from other blacks, were transported in the Transatlantic trade, and 11.5 million black slaves, mostly female, were transported in the Trans-Saharan trade (Cambridge World History of Slavery, Vol. 3), where views about the suitability of blacks for slavery seem to have originated."
"Tell you what; go walk the streets of a Chicago ghetto and see how friendly the reception is. better yet, go ask the Korean's, whom blacks targeted after Rodney King, if they think white people are more racist than blacks.
 in my case, as a teen in Portland-metro my best friend was black. half his family hated me with a passion simply because they thought I am white.
 now, about your last sentence, we have thrown hundreds of billions of dollars at the black community and including but not limited to preferential treatment through affirmative action, including hiring for jobs...the harm today they experience more racism than other races is purely deluded drivel perpetuated by those cashing in on the race card."
"Bush set the stage for the Trumpian upheaval

No, it is Obama. His black populist reign is so toxic, people can't speak openly against him, but they use ballots to revenge."
"This has been seen in a variety of numbers...we have working class white males who for the last forty years have felt like they were losing ground...they are! Of course much of this was self-inflicted as they lead the way to elect leaders who tapped into their angst..angry Reagan Democrats, soccer Mom's, tea-party and now 'the undertoads.' In each case union jobs left, high paying work was automated, other groups seemed to been rising while they fell, and services that were paid for by a civil society (health, tuition, taxes) were increasingly resting on their shoulders...they were told this was freedom. No, it was stupid! It's time to hear their pain and not belittle it...it's real even if their own damn fault. So what can we do? First is to stop pitting each against the other. Working class black mem and white men have a lot in common...helping to raise families, paying for college, dealing with a spouse who works too. They also are dealing with changes. Let's help them do both!"
How about we call BLM - black supremacists - and move on from there???
"We have a clear choice this election. The law and order candidate...
Or the black lives matter candidate.
Pick one."
The sky is falling! The sky is falling! This country has elected a black man twice! And now a woman! Please God! Make America Great Again! We're going down in flames!!!
"Your last sentence is lie that you can not prove.   Just one more way you want to dodge the damage done by racist white policy, enforcement and the court system.    You've tied you horse to the parade of cross burning murderers.    At LEAST you can acknowledge the horrors of racism historically.  Then you can ask yourself if the stories of you own grandparents and great grandparents still affect your own view of the world.

Sorry for the harshness Bill, but I lived in Houston in the 1950's and I remember the murder of MLK.   I remember a father who called Oregon blacks 'co*ons.   I stayed in black St. Louis projects and talked to police in that city.  ( at that point the area was 51% black and the police force 98% white), and talked to blacks 'stopped and beaten'.   It was a war on both sides, but only blacks went to jail.

We will agree on some things but you hit a very hot spot of my lifetime values."
This is good? This is a sure signal for other Toronto communities and individuals to shun blacks and gays.
"Being as we live in his fiefdom now, the first thing I noticed was that Granpa Comment Section sounds like he’s sundowning again.
But seriously — why is Sudan in, and Chad out?
Apart from “gotta have some bunch of black Africans to kick around”, which is I assume Steven Miller’s advice?"
"What did they say about the Black guy with BLM that shot cops?  Oh, that's right, nothing.  These people crave to be hated and work at it - deserve it."
"Now that we all are missing the point by just going off on each other for each others own beliefs which is really brave on all accounts being no one knows the other. Now that the players have stepped up there game on the fight to end racism and social in justice in this country, the President (yes I voted for the lesser of the 2 evils) made a bone headed statement that was just about as stupid as 99% of the comments that have been made.
 1. Am I to believe anything the press has to say? I read that the entire Dallas Cowboy team and owner took a knee for the anthem. 
2. What is any of this doing to help?
3. What are the NFL players doing to change this Press generated problem? and how is that working for them?
4. Just to set the record straight... I work in Charlottesville VA all the time. the people there are good. We have racism in all skin colored people BLACK as well as WHITE KKK BLM all a bunch of losers!
When do we get back to owning our own problems?

When do we get back to NFL?"
"Can't be, only brown and black people are illegals! Those Irish and the Poles and Canadians, etc, just accidentally stayed on expired tourist visas by a dozen years or more.  They can't be illegals, they are white after all!"
"I am totally with the residents of Ocean View, who have suffered much too much for much too long. These are people who were too black under apartheid and are now too white under ANC rule. They have had to suck the hind tît since 1994 while the economic refugees from the Eastern Cape have been given all sorts of support in 'Site 5' - otherwise known as Masiphumelele - and they have got nothing. When I hear of parents keeping their kids indoors the whole time while gangsters brazenly walk the streets with guns that apparently come from a seriously undermanned police station, I can completely understand them being gatvol. It looks like they've finally cracked and resorted to demonstrating, like the Masi people always do. I hope it brings some urgent attention from the authorities, but I won't hold my breath because even the Cape City Council seem blinded by the need to be 'pro-poor' but only interpret that as meaning 'black', not 'coloured'."
"Oh come on, Rinehart.  tRump's after weak ones like you.  Hillary doesn't need weak voters to back her.  Women, blacks and Hispanics have Hillary's back.  Wonk, wonk, wonk."

"What a load of tripe you just spewed forth, you sir need glasses.
The girl (4) was white, the boy (8) was black. I have watched this video many times due it its poor quality and can assure you that your talking absolute rubbish. The birthday girl (not involved in any way) was black and celebrating her 4th birthday. 
The white father approached the black woman in a polite manner and asked her to take action, the woman responded by swearing at the man. He again responded in a polite manner which resulted in her hurling more insults at him. At this point he swore at her a walked away, SHE continued hurling abuse at him so he turned round and exploded.
He made a grab at the boy and told him to go apologize to the girl, the mother ripped the boy back.
AT NO TIME did the girls father tell the girl to hit the boy. 
Please ensure you gets your facts straight before posting utter rubbish.
PS would you do nothing if a boy slapped your daughter in the face?"
"Only the media were offended or at least acted that way so they could sell an inflammatory story. Oh yeah, and Blacks were offended but they take offensive at everything that doesn't glorify or belong to them."
Apparently this black church group hasn't heard about Trump screaming at his white staff to hide the black employees when ever he came into his buildings.
black on black crime..
"Sherrilyn Ifill is a total fool who wrote this article based on false presumptions. She presume that all white officers acted in such a way because they may be racist toward blacks. She failed to understand that sometimes, black officers shoot white people without just cause, like that case in Louisiana where a white autistic boy was shot by black sheriff. Is that overt act of racism, eh? Police work is a difficult job and often, people who may not be qualified mentally may still wear the uniform. Most of these shooting take place because the officers claims that they ""fear for his/her life"" despite of the fact that there may not be any visible threat. Fear of a threat, is not good enough to kill. There got to be a clear threat. In all three shooting, it was the fear that triggered the shots. This does make you wonder if some of the police officers are too fearful of a personality to do their job? After all, most Marines will run toward the fire, but the few will go the opposite way."
"When I see two black males walking on the same sidewalk as me, I cross the street.

"Respectfully, if you refer to advocating black inmates take revenge on this pathetic little coward who murdered those who WELCOMED him among them according to the Messiah's admonishments concerning hospitality to strangers, I very much understand his 'sentiments'.  The Creator has promised to punish the unrepentant according to their deeds.  May Roof be murdered nine times after arriving in hell, and then shunned as a pariah therein for eternity--just as his victims were maltreated as if they were less than human all their lives under Jim Crow terror and tyranny, and thereafter had to watch helplessly as their youth were gunned down by both criminals and the cops who were supposed to protect them, until finally being murdered themselves.

Were it up to me, Roof would be stripped naked, plastered with hog-slop, kneecapped then thrown into a pit full of starving pigs.  And I say this knowing that to torture mortals is hara'am (Islamically unlawful).  Lannatullahi alayhi alf mura'at."
"""What scares me is he never takes responsibility for anything, meaning he is always in need of scapegoats. Historically, this has been women, Jews, blacks, Hispanics and LGBT.""

Never taking responsibility for ones actions and blaming them on others is a hallmark of a psychopath."
"Is this guy for real?

All was 'peaches and cream' in the Muslim world before the Europeans did .. what exactly - invented 'racism'? And 'Muslim identity'?

Does he know how non-black Muslims refer to black Muslims? 'Abd', Abeed - isn't that 'slave(s)' in Arabic!
.
Or, why is there a special 'treatment' for Kafirs? Why were non-Muslim taxed exorbitant amounts? Why is/was non-Muslim human deemed  dispensable in the Muslim culture?
.
 And so on.

To write an article like this one, one is either 'an useful idiot' or a willing tool at Mullahs disposal."
"Thank God for video proof! Again, LEO lies about why they shot an unarmed black man. People just assume LEO always tell the truth, when time after time they are caught lying about what really happened. Clearly, this is another example where LEO was involved in a shooting and they shooter straighten lied to save his sorry ass. Why lie? It seems to me the officer knew they should not have used deadly force and they tried to save their ass and blame the dead. 

Side note: 
Why the f%#^ can't cops kill sexual predators and child abusers? Am I asking too much of LEO??"
"Maybe, because, all of the academic connections of most of Congress are Radical Liberals and these politicians fear being black balled by their alma maters."
"There are outpourings of sorrow and concern for police that die in the line of duty; as there should be! Where is the equivalent national sobbing and tear fest when unarmed Americans (especially Black Americans) are shot and killed by police? Aren't their lives just as valuable? Isn't the loss to their family and community just as heartbreaking? When a law enforcement officer is killed, every effort is made to find and punish the killer. When police shoot and kill an unarmed citizen, (like a 12 year old Black child playing with a pellet gun), they get a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. This cannot continue! It is an abomination on this country! And maybe this unpunished killing of unarmed citizens by Police is why crazy people walk up to a Law Enforcement Officer they don't even know and shoot them."
"Sir, you labour under a misapprehension.
Fact: I site CCTV footage, and state that it cannot be held inferior to so called eye witness accounts
Fact: I quote eyewitness accounts precisely to show how unreliable they are, NOT to support my arguments. This is because depending on what ""media source"" or account you read, the versions are startlingly different.

As a non SA living here, I took particular pains to read accounts from both sides and watch the full footage before drawing my conclusion, perhaps thinking that I could be more objective as I lack historical context. Here's what I found:
""Fact"": The black girl complained three times previously go her mum she was being bullied by the white. Mum banned her from the play area but she snuck back and hit the white child. Yet now I also hear, long after that initial ""fact"" was common knowledge, another ""fact"", ie the white child complained three times previously.
""Fact"": At no point did the child's mother desvribe the ""8 year old boy"""
"Let's see. Republicans elected Mr. Deficit, Ronald Reagan. Should have been impeached for lying to Congress in Iran-contra Scandal. 
Then, GHWB: S & L Scandal sank the economy for years.
Then, W. (No Republicans ""claim"" him; his eight years might as well have occurred in the Twilight Zone).
Intelligent Republicans elected an obviously declined Reagan to a second term and granted another four years to W.
Meanwhile, we had the candidacies of McCain (who allowed Bush falsely to accuse him of fathering a black child yet embraced him weeks later; now, after Trump similarly assassinates his character for his service to his country--- Johnny embraces him, too). 
Sarah Palin. Not worth the ink to criticize. 
Mitt.
Goodness, what a pantheon of fools.
Meanwhile, Clinton balanced the budget, handing W a future where the debt would have been retired.
After W, we have Obama who saved GM and is halfway to paying off the MASSIVE federal debt that staggeringly was run up by W's wars."
I'm a black man that managed to survive the Jim Crow days. Do you miss the good old days when a white man could get away with murdering black people while they pray in church?
"It is time. America.

It is time for racist America to accept responsibility and be held accountable for creating a despicable racist monster as Donald Trump. The key to Trump’s rise to power is America’s pride of its slave days and the wanton killing of Native Americans of the American West.

What we see and experience today is part of that legacy. 

There is no other explanation. That legacy is here in Anchorage with the wanton killings of Native people  on our streets, run down like animals and left to die. It is in our cities by rogue hate cops killing black and brown people at will. 

Donald Trump, with all of his hate and bigotry, from his “hate Obama is not an American birther” days to his kick all 11-million Hispanics out, is your creation. I can only conclude that might include some of my Hispanic family.

And the white media? They all smile and laugh about Trump like high-school kids watching a school-yard bully."
Immigrants r the reason why I agree with Trump. Can't speak a lit of english. Americans we are allowing immigrants to learn the American dream and they going to use it against us. I love in Chicago.  I hate it's a sanctuary city. We have a big population of immigrants.  The Mayor only care about the well being of immigrants. He don't care about what's going on in the black community. He trying to get funding for immigrants. He don't care what happens to blacks. We can kill ourselves. That makes more room for immigrants. He always talking about money to build more things for tourist. That can bring jobs. If all this violence keep happening. Ain't no tourist be coming to Chicago.  He need to get Chicago right first. His vote is out for me being re elected. 4 and a half finger lol. Trump u need help building that wall. America is black and white not immigrants. Immigrants are sneaky. How u think they snook in America.

And we have a report from 4 yrs ago of a jewish man who was caught spray-painting swastikas in Brooklyn.  These incidents are actually quite common.

"Great article. Just as I have a problem with a tiny black elite reserving the right to enjoy the fruits of freedom for itself, in the name of all black people, I have a problem with elite women advancing their careers and access to the spoils of freedom in the name of the multitude of economically excluded women. These parasitic elites are part of the problem of poverty and exclusion; they are not the solution."
Planned Parenthood locates in poor neighborhoods because that’s where blacks and Hispanics are.
"Ask yourself what percentage of black folks are incarcerated compared to white folks. At some point, a person of color interested in a sensible, non-victimized discussion will have to admit that there is a real, long-standing crime problem within her community.

"Waianae won't get squat from the ruling democratic party. They know that only 10% of the people out there vote, and those that do vote mostly for Dems. They're viewed and treated much like the predominantly poor black inner city communities on the mainland. They get less because they are worth less in the eyes of the political elite decision makers.
And it's not just roads, it's schools, healthcare, parks and everything else that improves the quality of life for residents. Keep voting for the same corrupt politicians and expect a different result,"
"Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't a lot of black people vote for Trump?  I am no Trump supporter and believe the only reason he got elected was because the best the Democrats could offer was Hillary, but Trumps message resonated with a lot working people of all races. 
Now I also find it disgustingly egocentric for Andra Gillespie to act as if she is speaking for all black Americans.  She isn't."
"Let's be clear on what the protests aim to do - protest against police brutality and its treatment of black Americans.  There is NO disrespect intended for the flag, the military, or the country...even though Trump would have you believe otherwise.

Shame on Trump to turn this argument against thoughtful and concerned black American NFL players.  More white NFL players should join the protest movement.  After all, assault on black Americans is an assault against humanity."

"The trans movement is driven by man-hating feminists who want to save boys by convincing them that they're really girls.

"""I do not believe that black men are more violent than white men."" 

But the murder statistic proves they are.  We agree that the cause is not their race, per se.  And if it isn;t race, the question becomes:  What, other than race, explains the disproportionate murder rate among black men?  You say it ""finding your self in certain circumstances.""  OK. But what are those circumstances?  In what circumstance do a considerable number of black male children find themselves?   You say, ""I think that we ought to pay attention to the circumstances that create an atmosphere that promotes, or encourages violence, or make it likely and then work to change the circumstances.""  That is precisely what I have been saying."

"What a contrived argument.  A circular diatribe that gets nowhere fast, but finally lands on what I guess might be its basic premise . . . that white people, (or unions,) don't have the right to be concerned about Sir John A. McDonald, only natives have the right to posthumously assassinate his character, or the legitimacy to do so.

Quite apart from the question of whether Sir John ought to be castigated, (I don't believe he should,) the notion that only natives should get to pass judgement on an historical figure is ludicrous.

As an aside, the idea that aboriginals receive an education at all was quite enlightened in its time.  The prevailing attitude was that ""savages,"" were a lesser form of human, (the same attitude that justified the slavery of millions of black ""savages,"" from Africa.)  The motive of Sir John in establishing schools for natives was a noble one, to allow the natives to progress by joining the new society in North America, to leave savagery behind."
"Malema is a racist pig who intentionally wants violence.

So blacks are allowed to protest but not whites? WTF?

And then why is rubber bullets needed when protests are peaceful? Unlike the marches of the EFF where there is always violence. Where do white people burn things and break things during their marches?
If they did, then rubber bullets are welcome.

So people have a protest against MURDERS and he wants those people to be shot with rubber bullets? Let alone that the marches were entirely peaceful.

He is so hateful and full of anger and violence that I would not be surprised if the EFF sits behind some of the farm murders.

Nobody can save this country if the EFF ever comes into power. Malema is such a hate-filled racist that this country will end in civil war because of him. 

The EFF openly stated how they want to destabilize anything run by the DA and their members have been visible at all violent university protests.

"Gasp! Horror! The state trying to prolong apartheid i.e. the oppression of black people and their treatment as sub-humans.

Yeah, yeah... the old stereotype about how all black guys look alike... guilty.

Will never forget how angry he was after fighting for his country, getting injured and then feeling totally abandoned.  The only person who had listened to him at all on that day was some some naive, white kid from Nova Scotia who really had little idea what he had gone through while in Vietnam and what problems he had faced since coming back to America after the war.  This was, of course, back in the day when people actually talked to each other face to face... not tweeted at each other at a distance.

There is significance in everyone's actions if we can only make an effort to listen to appreciate what it's like to walk in another man's shoes.

"A liberal could explain it but has to lie about it because the public wouldn't accept the truth.  The eugenics movement whose goal is to limit the number of undesireables a.k.a. black and brown births, uses the well worn ""women's rights to choose"",  ""planned parenthood"" and "" women's health"" to mask their real intent.  Couple that with the very profitable baby parts swap meet they run and it's simple to see why they can't be honest."
Blacks kill whites no big deal. Whites kill black and its a hate crime. The double standard is disgusting.. Must be because whites are always racist and blacks cant be racist cause Black Lives Matter says so...

"Depends.   As every situation is different.   So when people compare situations say because this dude was white vs that dude was black....I mean in the end it is never an apples to apples comparison.   Every single situation is different.

This guy might be super lucky they didn't put a beat down on him.  or shoot him.  Or he could have been so drunk and slurring he wasn't a threat, didn't seem like he was tough to disarm.   Who knows.  I know you don't.   So hard to compare.
I do think you are an idiot if you threaten the cops, no matter your color.  Best to just STF and get in the backseat quietly."

"""Mourned the killings of unarmed African-Americans""

Not one word about the blacks who targeted, ambushed, and killed cops simply because they were cops.....in some other jurisdiction.....even in some other state? Such ""selective thinking"" on Fitzgibbons part is wrong because it only help fuel groups like the KKK."
"''This horrible event demonstrates just how overheated our political rhetoric has become, and how little it may take to set off some disturbed individuals to commit violence. In America, no one should have their life threatened because of their political beliefs and their relationship with others shouldn’t be based on whether their political party wins or loses an election. That’s the way they do it in some Third World countries, not here.''
huh, some right winger seems to have conveniently forgotten the solemn promises of the vast array of trump-loving hate mobs and lone loons to kill Hillary if she won, or the many vestiges of a lynched Obama seen nation wide, or punks for trump punching out innocent blacks and women. gee, how oddly hypocritical, or more correctly, how typical."
"Exposure to illnesses as a part of 'exploring' and or conquering territory is far from limited to North America.  Or perhaps you forgot about little epidemics like the black death (introduced into Europe from Asia).  You also seem to have forgotten about some of the mini epidemics that broke out in various ports throughout Europe after early expeditions to the Americas returned.  Finally you incorrectly put FAR too much weight on reports some morons tried to get natives sick by giving them 'infected' blankets.  1.  Simple greed is a much easier explanation and 2 the infections they were attempting to spread didn't spread that way and it was known that they didn't spread that way at the time. That kind of nonsense is like saying gay men were trying to spread HIV by holding hands.

As for the treaties, you must not follow history very closely.  The treaties with various tribes were all horribly flawed in multiple ways.

""" Much of the violence in Charlottesville was black on white (or representatives thereof). No sentence enhancement there.""

So far, I've only seen white dudes kill at the charlotte rally, or get charged with crimes. There was the crying nazi, pretty sure he wasn't black."
"No it is not ok to accept gays watever into the church with the hope of reforming them.  There is no way of changing a gay person into a straight person.  Like changing a black into a white.  Might be possible of changing a white into a black  (Black like me) but I have never heard of the opposite.  

Now why would anyone disapprove and criticize a life style?"
I don't much like your statements either Bill and I'm as white as you can get.    There is no historical equivalency between the death and damage to black Americans and white Americans in terms of racial discrimination.
"Of course they refuse to give out the race of the attackers and victim.  It's not PC to do it.  I'd put money on it that the feds will not charge them with a hate crime.  I'm sure they did it because they have been denied something...  I have no idea what would ever justify it.

My question is what would be happening now had the races been reversed and it would have been Obama and blacks being cursed?  Al Sharpton, where are you now, protestors???"
"Emily, though I agree with Tebow and not the other guy, this is thin gruel.
You say Tebow was supported, but Kap(whatever) was criticized. How facile.
The Leftists anti-religionists howled about Tebow, and Black Americans - far more than just the Black Lives Matters thugs, support the anti-police, anti-white supremacist (again, whatever) kneelers, whom - you might have noticed - are overwhelmingly Black (or African American or . . . you know)."
"There is a ""National Association of White People"". It's a white supremacist group. NAACP conversely is a civil rights group due to 400 years of anti-black racism and white supremacy. 

Affirmative action for whites is the default setting in America and has been since the 17th century on this continent. It used to be called the good ol' boy network. That's what the nature of anti-black racism is about. Centuries of inter-generational race-based slavery, followed by segregation, denial of access, voter suppression, terrorism was put in place to preserve white preferences and affirmative action. That's also what Manifest Destiny is.

Donald Trump is the poster boy for white affirmative action. He's the unqualified boorish mean racist divisive white candidate who was elected because he spoke to white backlash, not because he laid out any realistic or specific policy proposals (""I know more than the generals"" and ""I have the best words"" and ""Muslim ban"" aren't realistic policy proposals)."
"Baking a cake for a wedding is celebrating that ceremony and the acts which are the expression thereof. 

Do we want liberal Sharia where Christian bakers are bullied for taking what the Bible says about homosexual activity sinful?  Why is it so important to get a wedding cake from someone with a religious objection when there are plenty of bakers with no objection happy to take the money?  The comparison with segregation is just to invoke an emotional response. There is no Scripture that teaches black and white people can't eat together, but there is Scripture that teaches marriage is between a man and a woman and homosexual sex is sinful."
"yep, he made the mistake of governing while black in a country that still has a race problem."

Well, Pierre de Vos, who believes in redress and AA except when it comes to his own tenured position, has just proved his own biases.   The ZANC, masquerading a ""transformation"" prefers to appoint judges who will be biased AGAINST pale, stale males with wealth.   It is noticeable that very few of the ""civil rights background"" appointees have ever, as advocates or academics,  defended the civil rights of the hated White class."

YOUR last PROFESSIONAL PLAINTIFF effort here a few months ago was shot down.. YOU have LOST ALL CREDIBILITY here in this city, county, state. I personally know four people who work with you in and around YOU. NONE of them like YOU. And, its worse than that. I am told a MAJORITY of workers around YOU, DO NOT LIKE YOU. Lane County needs to clean out the BAD APPLES, and YOU are not only a BAD APPLE, YOU are a ROTTEN APPLE.

Not being black perhaps the Sanchez family will get some justice....I hope....
"Racism is one of those hot-button terms that is ill-defined and/or misapplied.  Many people are afraid of the inner city, not because the people are Black, but because the news reports all of the crime that is there and the houses are run-down, etc....  Many people fear Muslims and darker-skinned people because the news reports Muslim terrorism.  But there are also fears of, say, trailer parks and rural, woody areas - populated by White people -
 because of the reputation of the people who live in such places.

As animals, we make judgments based on appearance and our associations of how appearance can translate into behavior.  If we do not do that, then we're being stupid.

But I think the days of judging people purely on their race are long gone in the US, notwithstanding that little show in Charlottesville, organized by a former Obama supporter.  I think we need to realize in this country that race baiting has become an industry of sorts."
The very successful play Hamilton had black actors playing white roles--no protests there but acceptance and enjoyment. PC has gone too far--was BLM involved as they seem to hate women and Whites.
"Should black people stop eating pizza or hot dogs? White people food is for white people and black people food is for black people, right?  We are being scolded we are all to stay on our own sides of the racial divides, so that applies to everybody. STOP!!  Put down that glass of wine and unto thine own self be true.  But of course all that  race shaming does not apply himself."
"It is complicated.  For every moron who says something like ""you don't look that black to me""  there is a society (plenty of people) which still seems to all too often implement the ""one drop"" convention, as mixed race people try to manoeuvre though the minefield.  I get her frustration."
"I'm guessing with the current state of affairs black people are just naturally putting their hands up in an effort not to be shot.  Though everyone keeps saying what would he go to his car for other than a gun? I call it simple logic I keep my registration in my damn car in the glove box along with my insurance.  Usually a cop always asks for license and registration even if you're broke down.  So I would assume that's what he headed to his car for, because that would be my instinct but since he's dead we will never know now will we?"
"Sad... 90% of NBA players are black and living high off the hog and they feel the need to protest about oppression while being the oppressors themselves... I believe in general that white people, as well as other races, are not out to to get them. They, including myself (and I'm not white), are just tired of their violence, petty grienvences, constant complaining, blind solidarity, and double standards... In all honesty, we were putting that into the past until someone started the stoking the coals of racism again... Sad..."
Spoken by someone without a clue and who has never been to Africa.  The murders are White farmers being killed by Blacks and the government  watches it happen
"After researching the reason why Miss AK didn't win, I discovered the answer to the key question by the winner.  She is a Black woman from D.C.  She has a high paying job.  In answer to a pageant question, she stated she did not believe healthcare was a ""right"", but a ""privilege"".  Anyone unemployed didn't ""deserve"" healthcare paid by those who are employed. If the question and answer carried any actual weight in the voting, Miss AK should have won instead of this privileged individual's idiotic response to the key question.  Plus she wasn't as pretty as Miss AK."
"The primary driver of white nationalism is the failure of American culture to acknowledge, much less address, the massive disparity between black on white violence versus white on black violence. US DOJ stats are clear - blacks assault/murder/rape whites at rates averaging 7Xs the rate at which whites victimize blacks."
Some how we are supposed to believe everything Indians and blacks say. In my neighbourhood every Indian is up to no good besides the drinking and drugs and sneaking into apartment buildings at night and defecating and urinating in the stair wells. Blacks have accosted me a number of times . Of course I racial profile.
"You white folks will say anything to deny responsibility for your behavior. Now you are telling us that white slaves were the real victims of slavery. I guess they should be grateful that black folks got race based slavery and saved ""poorly educated"" white folks from slavery. Heck, we didn't even get 40 acres and a mule for rescuing those poorly educated white folks from slavery, many of them being Irish. You would think they would be more grateful. Thank goodness younger white folks are less racist than their elders. That is particularly true about those with good educations."
"Quite an exhaustive investigation you did there. Ever heard of ""institutional racism""? So you actually expect a black cab driver to candidly discuss racism? I can't say for sure whether Trump is a racist, but the fact that is a despicable and disgusting human being does it for me."
"Your cut and paste skills far exceed your ability to rationalise and debate. Where have I justified aparheid?
Yes, white Christian Europeans traded in african slaves - detestable. Over the same period and beyond, black africans were traded by Arabs, black Africans were kidnapped and traded BY OTHER BLACK AFRICANS to European and Arab traders, and many more black Africans died at the hands of other black Africans in ordinary run-of-the-mill warfare in acceptable fashion - equally detestable."
"I doubt you would survive being black in this country. The 1st time you tried to argue with a cop, you would be killed and the cop would get time off with pay to recover from killing you. You would not survive childhood. Cops get away with killing black children too."

"I am shocked. Shocked! That Donald Trump has engaged in locker room banter! Meanwhile Democrat hero Ted Kennedy drives, while drunk, his secretary to the beach to have sex when he drives off a bridge, saves himself while his employee drowns, then shows up at his lawyer's house before reporting the accident. But that's OK. And meanwhile Bill Clinton fouls his intern before lying about it and getting impeached. But that's OK. Meanwhile Margaret Sanger, another Democrat hero, normalizes abortion, deliberately targeting Blacks and the poor in a quest to advance the White Race. And her name adorns Planned Parenthood's headquarters. And that's OK. Maybe Donald Trump did use some crude language (shocked faces turn pale!) but please, let the first politician without sin cast the first stone!"
"A progressive, feminist member of the lying MSM will, naturally, never miss a chance for a racist attack on white men.

According to Statista, between 1982 and 2017, out of 91 mass shootings the racial breakdown of shooters were as follows:

Whites: 51

Blacks: 15

Latino: 7

Asian: 7

American Indian: 3

Multi-race: 5

Unknown: 3

White shooters were about proportional to their presence in the population.

Blacks, American Indians, and Asians had more shooters than one might expect given their respective populations.

None of these statistics are happy ones.

What is also clear is that progressive feminists like Petri are always quick to pounce on a tragedy to advance their political agenda;  they never let facts hinder their lying progressive, feminist agenda."
"A social justice facilitator?  Huh? Maybe you should be on SNL....a comedy routine....

Sigh...Another whites are bad  ( and especially white heterosexual males ) humorless  sermon. Yawn. It is very tiresome. I think what you are seeing in North America is the birth of what a CNN commentator called a whitelash and this trend scares the left. People like me  are growing irritated at the constant focus of leftists and their supporters in the media  on identity politics. You can't open a newspaper without a story on natives, Black Lives Matter, LGBQT or whatever. Do families still exist in Canada as far as the media is concerned?

I know it irritates leftists like Ross but if you do the analytics on a global basis ( look at the data) you will see that whites ( and especially white males) control most of the world's wealth and governments.....this is not racist it is a hard fact. And that situation is unlikely to change....."
"Sarah - Are you saying Blacks don't have voter ID or are ""too dumb"" to have any type of identification? I think this is quite a racist comment. Maybe people are not voting because they don't like either party. Voter ID would seem to be reasonable thing to ask for to ensure fair elections. Also the illegal immigrant vote does not appear to be a lie as Sarah notes in her article. It is estimated 5.7 million illegals voted in the 2008 election.
It is not racist or white supremacy to make sure only US citizens can vote.

It seems like the Democratic party is blaming everyone but themselves."
"Jennifer Rubin knows nothing of history. Jennifer invents a brand new history when she writes Republicans have:

""...become the party of the Enemies of Lincoln.""

Jennifer Rubin does not understand that Lincoln was a vile racist.  Lincoln's own words illustrates the depth of his racism:

Two Lincoln Quotes:

""Our republican system was meant for a homogeneous people. As long as blacks continue to live with the whites they constitute a threat to the national life. Family life may also collapse and the increase of mixed breed basxxrds may some day challenge the supremacy of the white man.""

""I have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races. There is physical difference between the two which, in my judgment, will probably forever forbid their living together...""

Lincoln said even worse in the forth of the Lincoln- Douglas debates."
"Yeah, a white man can't catch a break in this country anymore. Bet you wish you were black, eh?  Geeeeezus . . . 

White conservatives are not ""ridiculed and denounced"" because they're white, Bill. They face ridicule when they say stupid, imperceptive things, as does everyone in public life. 

I am curious, though,  What are some of these disadvantages of whiteness you perceive? Have you been turned down for a mortgage because you're white? Lost your job because the boss was black? Been forced to use a separate door at the courthouse?"
"You might want to check out what Southern Poverty Law Center has to say about Johnson and black separatist groups:

https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/07/08/dallas-sniper-connected-black-separatist-hate-groups-facebook

During negotiations, Johnson told Dallas police ""he was upset about 'Black Lives Matter."" That doesn’t mean BLM is to blame. I would lay more blame on the media for inflaming the white-cop-shoots-unarmed-black-man narrative."
"""(T)he inner city ghettos are mostly found in liberal controlled jurisdictions."" Why do you think that is, Phil? You seem to be saying that if those urban ""ghettos"" (neighborhoods would be less pejorative) were ""controlled"" by conservatives, they would be at economic parity with white neighborhoods. That is plainly, stupendously stupid. Those neighborhoods vote Democratic because they aren't stupid and they know that Republicans don't give a damn about them. 

Neither do you. Your rant is nothing but a racist diatribe. I have lived in black urban neighborhoods. The people are nicer than white neighbors. And here you are to prove your bigotry, saying that equality ""will NEVER happen"", because ""all people have different strengths and weaknesses.""

You are a bigot, Phil, and you are ignorant. Willfully so, because you have never talked to your black neighbor, man to man. You are as bad a bigot as it gets."
"Substitute black for white, women for man or include muslim in the description and see if the WP or DP would publish this. Objective symetry?  Alexandra is so brainwashed she would be utterly confused as to what I am talking about."
And people wonder why so many young black males are behind bars.
"Are you saying we need an actual war to tear down all the monuments to racism and tyranny that you Unite the Right guys love so much?

The fact that the white supremacists are willing to have another Civil War rather than give up their monuments to white supremacy, anti-black racism, and tyranny says it all. Wouldn't be a complete day on the internet if a nutty racist wasn't salivating for a new civil war. Pathetic.

See you at the broadcast of the next Unite the Right rally. I'll look for the unhinged guy with the nazi armband over his Colorado t-shirt, waving a mosquito repelling tiki torch, sweating, spitting, grinding his teeth, shouting ""bring on the next Civil War, man! Bring it on! White power now and forever, man! You'll have to pry my racist tyrannical statues out of my cold dead hands, man!"""
"""We are talking about a clear mental deficiency. ""

Oh that's your professional opinion, is it? Please provide your qualifications, what's your PhD?

And blacks were considered mentally inferior too, so this bogus reason you've offered doesn't successfully counter my point anyway."
"Thats what he's doing genius. He's supposed to fight for the causes of his constituents do you not understand our form of government? If they do not like it they will vote him out I doubt you live in his area but maybe you do. Are you even aware the national anthem started as a Pub song, and sounded little like the boring ass one you hear today. By the way Jesus has no historical documentation, other that the bible and by that logic Thor is real too along w Zeus, but also if he had been real you would refer to him as being black, and being black he would probably take a knee, and not berate, and become angry with people protesting violence."
"Free speech for everyone! Well except for Conservatives and any others who disagree with the Black Lives Matter thugs and their Comrades in the resistance. If you don't like what the KKK people are saying then shut up, don't listen and go home."
"What a wholly ignorant, in the worst way, statement.  Blacks have voted democratic since they were pushed out of the party of lincoln by white racists.  If BO was a conservative and blacks were conservative leaning they would have voted the same way.  The majority of white people in America didnt vote for BO; hence the Obama coalition.  Black and brown people also voted in larger numbers because it was a history making election, BLACK man running for, and having a good chance to become president in a country whose history and riches is built on white supremacy.  They didnt come out in the same numbers afterwards, hence he lost control of the congress.  But yes, lets try to paint black (and brown) peoples with the same racist brush; let's pretend that black people having 'racial' bias is the same as white racists who own the systems; lets pretend they have the power to impact the lives of whites in the same way; let's pretend that a black trump would have been elected to the presidency."
"frank, wow, not much i can add to that, except that i wonder where you got that bs. the fbi crime report for 2015 shows that, indeed, hate crimes against jew headed the 'religious' hate crime category, but, blacks continued their first place position of 'most hate crimes', for the 400th year in a row, i think. the difference is that a vandalized jewish headstone gets the same, or in some cases more, air and other media time than when a black man is dragged behind a truck until his head is separated from his torso. im sure there is a reason for this, a justification, besides that the media is white owned. remember good, but black ethiopian jews, and the arms wide open love and acceptance that awaited their arrival by white israelites. i dont know if there is a real christian left on this planet earth. right here in hawaii we have over 600,000 professed christians and 8000 homeless people. what would jesus do?????  i'm sorry folks, but i meet a lot of hypocrites on my daily rounds."
